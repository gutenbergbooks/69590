<h2 class="nobreak" id="toclink_iii">PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The</span> fact that salt is almost universally distributed
over the surface of the globe, and has been worked in a
number of countries from time immemorial, will explain
the impossibility, in the limited space at my disposal,
to consider the mineral and its manufacture comprehensively
as the staple of a world-industry. The salt
deposits of China, India, Russia, Japan, and Austria
would each require a volume of the size of this if
the subject was to be even adequately represented. I
have, therefore, dared to assume that the public will
accept a book practically restricted to one phase of the
matter, and allow me to concentrate upon our Cheshire
salt district and its industry.</p>

<p>Caesar’s <em>salinators</em>, who found the natives of Cheshire
procuring brine from little natural springs in the
neighbourhoods of Northwich and Nantwich, taught
them to boil the brine and precipitate the salt crystals
in open pans set over open fires, and in the following
1,700 years all the salt of Cheshire was manufactured
by that process. With the discovery of rock salt in
1670, mining was introduced, and for another 200 years
both rock salt and brine salt were produced. But from
causes which I have described, the mines collapsed in
rapid succession from about the middle of the nineteenth
century, and fresh water breaking into the
abandoned workings converted them into the brine
reservoirs from which the salt-men have since obtained
their inexhaustible supplies of brine.</p>

<p>But, although the salt industry is one of the oldest in
the country, it has received scant treatment at the
hands of authors, and this is accounted for by the fact<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">iv</span>
that the trade has been conducted by a comparatively
small group of men who have resisted all attempts of
outsiders to participate in either their secrets or their
profits. The desire for information has been consistently
rebuked, and practical details relating to
borings, working expenses, levels of brine, and quantities
raised have been jealously concealed. It was my
good fortune to be able to prosecute most of my
researches on the spot, and to supplement the knowledge
gained from books, pamphlets, scientific papers
and periodicals, with material contained in private
records and documents placed at my disposal, and
information obtained by word of mouth.</p>

<p>There is romance in every industry, and a modicum
of it enters into the development of the Cheshire salt
trade; but for the most part the story is a chronicle
of bitter struggles to maintain a monopoly, of money
thrown away, of produce sold at ruinous loss, of obsolete
methods stubbornly persisted with, and of hardship
and injustice callously inflicted—in a word, of the
sordid determination of the salt magnates to crush
competition and control prices. The methods of the
Dark Ages survived both in the manufacture and the
marketing of the produce, and the industry has more
than once been reduced almost to ruin through the
war of extermination in which for so many years the
salt-men were engaged. It is not a pretty story, but
it is one of unusual interest; and I have endeavoured
in the telling of it to retain the interest and preserve
the essential facts.</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">“Salt”</span> was the name which was given in the first
place to the residue left by the evaporation of sea-water,
but the designation was subsequently employed to
include the other substances held in solution in the
sea, and, at a still later period, the name was still
further extended by chemists to cover all the combinations
of a base and an acid which are now classed
as “salts.” Sodium, or sodic chloride Na Cl, which is
now distinguished as “common salt,” is an example of
the simplest type of chemical salt, its molecule consisting
of one atom of the metal sodium combined
with one atom of the gas chlorine, both sodium and
chlorine being mono-valent elements, <i>i.e.</i>, one atom of
each being able to unite with, or displace from a
compound, one atom of hydrogen.</p>

<p>Rock-salt is rarely found in an absolutely pure
anhydrous state, in which it is colourless and perfectly
transparent. In most rock-salt mines such specimens
are regarded as curiosities, but in the deposits of Nevada
and of Wieliezka, in Hungary (where the salt, containing
100 per cent. NaCl, is the purest in the world), large
masses of quite transparent salt are encountered. The
white opaque mass which the ordinary person is accustomed
to think of as rock-salt, is the purified product<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
of commerce. The colour of sea-water is affected by
its percentage of salt, the colour changing from blue to
green as the quantity of salt decreases; but sea-salt is
generally white, although not transparent owing to the
presence of minute particles of water, air, etc., in its
intercrystalline spaces. But rock-salt is never more
than whitish inclining to grey, and, as a general rule,
it is coloured by earth or mineral impurities. The
Salt Range in the Panjab yields a substance that varies
from pink to red, according to the different quantities
of iron present as impurities. That found at Marston,
in Cheshire, varies from yellow to red and brownish-red
in colour. Small blocks of transparent salt of a deep
sapphire blue are occasionally found in the Wieliezka
mines. The colour disappears on heating, and when
the salt is ground to powder. It is attributed by some
chemists to the presence of subchloride of sodium, by
others to the presence of thin cavities having parallel
surfaces with gas inclusions.</p>

<p>Common salt, which is classed as “sweet” to distinguish
it from the bitter-tasting salts of magnesium,
has a peculiar saline taste which gains in pungency
with refinement, and in its pure state is odourless.
In solution, the smallest quantity perceptible to the
taste is about 15 grains to the litre, roughly, 68 grains
to the gallon.</p>

<p>Common salt is highly soluble in cold water, and
rather more so in hot water, but while it dissolves
slightly in alcohol, neither ether nor oil has any effect
upon it. One hundred parts of distilled water at
60° F. (15·5° C.) will dissolve 35·9 parts of chemically
pure NaCl. A saturated solution of common salt,
therefore, contains 26·42 per cent. NaCl. The increase
of solubility of NaCl in proportion to the rise in temperature,
calculated by Gay Lussac and Poggiale, is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
particularly marked between 100 deg. and 110 deg.,
when boiling point is passed, the increase amounting
to ·74 parts of 10 deg., as compared with an increase
of one 1·09 parts between freezing and boiling points.
In a double solution of NaCl and some other more
soluble salt, as sodium or magnesium sulphate or
magnesium chloride, the solubility of sodium chloride
is very greatly reduced.</p>

<p>The evaporation of brine is slightly less rapid than
that of ordinary pure water, and the boiling point of
brine varies with the amount of NaCl present in solution,
from 100·21 deg. when only 1 per cent. NaCl is present,
to 108·99 deg. when the solution contains 29·4 per cent.
of NaCl. A saturated solution of refined table-salt
(<i>i.e.</i>, a solution containing 26·4 per cent. NaCl) has,
at normal temperatures, specific gravity 1·2. Salt
crystals have specific gravity 2·167 at a temperature
of 17°. The salt which separates at high temperature
contains no water of crystallization. But when the
thermometer falls much below -15° C. the crystals
have the composition NaCl.2H₂O and are prismatic in
shape. When heated, these give up their water of
crystallization and take the simple composition NaCl.</p>

<p>Pure sodium chloride is not deliquescent (<i>i.e.</i>, it does
not dissolve and become liquid by absorbing moisture
from the air), but, owing to the presence of minute
quantities of magnesium chloride (one of the most
deliquescent substances known), all except the most
refined table-salt appears to be so to a slight extent.
Even the finest table-salt is slightly hygroscopic, its
crystals absorbing as much as ·6 per cent. moisture
from a damp atmosphere. In some of the mines of
Cheshire and Austria the very fine saline dust that is
diffused through the atmosphere is found by the miners
to be extremely irritating to the eyes and lungs, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
all the more usual kinds of salt are sufficiently hygroscopic
to indicate plainly the condition of the
atmosphere.</p>

<p>Sodic chloride melts at a very high temperature,
and at a still higher temperature it evaporates, while
at white heat it forms thick clouds.</p>

<p>It would be supposed that in the same ocean areas,
the proportion of the salt contents, except where
marked differences in temperature occur, would be
fairly constant, but it has been demonstrated that,
even where masses of water of varying densities are
superimposed upon each other, no very complete
process of diffusion takes place between them, and
practical salt-makers are familiar with differences in
density which occur in different parts of the same
salt pan.</p>

<p>The hardness of a mineral depends upon the degree
of cohesion of its particles; but although no unit of
hardness has been determined upon, and therefore no
accurate method of measuring hardness has been
arrived at, minerals have been approximately classed
in a comparative table of ten substances, of which
talc is placed at one end and diamond at the other.
In this table, rock salt appears in the second place,
and its hardness is estimated at 2·5. Its cohesion or
power of supporting pressure is, therefore, about twice
as great as that of bricks, and the practical advantage
of this property is fully employed in rock-salt mines,
where galleries and roofs are supported upon pillars
of salt.</p>

<p>Common salt is a crystalline substance which crystallizes
in the Isometric, Monometric, or Tesseral system.
That is to say, each crystal has three equal perpendicular
planes of symmetry and six equal diagonal planes of
symmetry. The crystals generally form cubes having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
six rectangular and equilateral faces. When these
form on the surface of brine the sides often collapse,
giving the distinctive “hopper-shaped” forms. More
rarely the crystals form in octahedra, having eight
equal, equilateral triangular faces, or in long needles
under certain modifying conditions.</p>

<p>The hollow quadrangular pyramidal form with an
irregular inner surface arranged in steps, which manufactured
salt generally takes, is the result of continuous
depositions of crystals from a constantly saturated
solution of brine during a considerable period, being
superimposed layer after layer upon each other.</p>

<p>In his exhaustive explanation of these phenomena,
given in his <cite>Principles of Chemistry</cite>, Mendeléeff says:
“If a solution of sodium chloride be slowly heated
from above, where the evaporation takes place, the
upper layer will become saturated before the lower and
cooler layers, and therefore crystallization will begin
on the surface, and the crystals first formed will float—having
also dried from above—on the surface until
they become quite soaked. Being heavier than the
solution the crystals are partially immersed in it, and
the following crystallization, also proceeding on the
surface, will only form crystals by the side of the original
crystals. A funnel is formed in this manner. It will
be borne on the surface like a boat (if the liquid be
quiescent) because it will grow more from the upper
edges. We can thus understand this, at first sight,
strange funnel-form of crystallized salt. To explain
why the crystallization under the above conditions
begins at the surface and not at the lower edges, it
must be mentioned that the specific gravity of a crystal
of sodium chloride is 2·16, and that a solution saturated
at 25° contains 26·7 per cent. of salt and has a specific
gravity 1·2004 at 25°; at 15° a saturated solution<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
contains 26·5 per cent. of salt and has a specific gravity
1·203 at 15°. Hence, a solution saturated at a higher
temperature is specifically lighter, notwithstanding the
greater amount of salt it contains. With many substances,
surface crystallization cannot take place,
because their solubility increases more rapidly with
the temperature than their specific gravity decreases.
In this case the saturated solution will always be in
the lower layers, where also the crystallization will
take place.”</p>

<p>The acoustic properties of common salt render it an
excellent medium for the transmission of sound, and
as it possesses in a high degree the power of staying
decomposition in dead organisms, it is, perhaps, the
commonest of all preservatives. It is largely owing to
its preservative property that common salt is an
absolute necessity to the life of man and the higher
animals, from a quarter to half an ounce a day being
sufficient to prevent the putrefaction of food in the
digestive tract in the case of an adult. In agriculture,
salt is not only valuable as a destroyer of weeds and
insect life, but used sparingly and with knowledge, it
forms an excellent manure; while its more strictly
chemical value in the manufacture of soda, chlorine,
etc., causes it to play an important part in many
branches of industry.</p>

<p>Even at the highest temperatures, heat cannot effect
the decomposition of common salt. At a red heat,
pure sodic chloride melts and becomes liquid, and if
cooled again, a solid crystalline mass is formed. Ordinary
salt fuses at a lower temperature and volatilizes when
heated in an open vessel. But even in a closed vessel
the purest salt will volatilize at a white heat. When
gases or fluids are present in the crystalline cavities,
heat causes decrepitation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span></p>

<p>On the subject of the composition of brine, it is only
necessary to add that it is so extremely variable that
no two districts produce brine springs of the same
strength and density, while the composition of ocean
brine varies not only from ocean to ocean, but also for
different parts and different depths in the same plane
of water, and with the different distances from the
mouths of large rivers. In the Cheshire district, the
Brine test or Salinometer is graduated to show ounces
in the gallon; but the gallon is the old Winchester
Gallon of 231 cub. in. and not the Imperial Gallon of
277·274 cub. in. These are related to each other in
the proportion of 10 to 12, therefore the Imperial
Gallon will contain ⅕ more than the old gallon. Fully
saturated brine by the Salinometer contains 42 oz.
(2 lb. 10 oz.), therefore, in the Imperial Gallon 50·4 oz.
As brines vary from 2 lb. 8 oz., or 40 oz. old measure,
or 3 lb. or 48 oz. Imperial to 2 lb. 10 oz., or 3 lb. 2 oz.
Imperial, so 1,000 gallons, which has been chosen as
the measure for assessing brine-pumpers—under the
Brine Pumping Compensation for Subsidence Act of
1891—will contain under the old measurement 2,625 lb.
and under the Imperial 3,125 lb. of salt.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE BEGINNINGS OF THE SALT INDUSTRY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Salt,</span> being existent in all animal and vegetable life,
is coeval with life itself; it was present in the first
herbage which gave nourishment to the first beast
that, in its turn, became food for the first omnivorous
man. In the beginning, man consumed the saline
essences that were required to preserve his body in
health, in the form of sodium chloride, which he absorbed
in the uncooked flesh of animals, birds, and fishes, and
in raw green-foods. The herbivorous animals were
equally dependent upon salt, and, finding it in only
infinitesimal quantities in the grasses upon which they
fed, instinct directed them to the sea swamp pasturage
and to the outcropping salt deposits. So long as man’s
diet consisted of uncooked foods, his fresh meat provided
him with a sufficiency of salt, but directly he
employed a cook-pot in the preparation of his food, the
boiling processes denuded it of 70 per cent. of its natural
salt, and it became necessary for him to make up the
deficiency. It must have been at this period that his
herds directed his attention to the “salt licks” from
which they satisfied their own saline wants, and enabled
him to secure salt as a distinct and separate
condiment.</p>

<p>It is probable that, from the Palaeolithic Age down
to the time of the early Roman writers, man was
content to season his victuals by the simple process of
licking a piece of rock-salt, and we have no record to
indicate the period when salt was first employed in
the cooking of food. From varieties of grain and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
fragments of pottery that have been discovered in the
dwellings of the cave-men of Belgium, it is supposed
that salt was employed in the cooking of wheat and
barley some five thousand years ago. Thirteen centuries
before Christ, fish preserved in salt was eaten in Ancient
Troy, and, according to Herodotus, the Egyptians not
only salted ducks, quails, and a species of sardine which
inhabited the Nile, but also employed salt or brine as an
antiseptic in preparing the bodies of the illustrious dead
for the process of embalming.</p>

<p>We cannot determine the period in which salt came
to be regarded as a symbol of sanctity or entered into
the religious ceremonials of the ancients. We know
that in the Levitical Law, promulgated in 1500 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>,
every meat-offering was seasoned with salt, and salt
is referred to in the “Verbal Instructions” which were
enunciated by the founder of Buddhism, five centuries
later. By the time of Pythagoras, about 600 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, salt
was regarded as the emblem of justice, but who shall
say when the Arabs first employed it as a token of
friendship, or the Chinese offered their first oblation
to Phelo, the salt deity of Celestial worship? We read
in Herodotus that caravans brought salt from North
Africa, and Schleiden tells us that the priests of Egypt
preferred the salt of Hammomen to that evaporated
from sea-water; but these references do not help us to
fix the date when salt became an article of commerce,
or tell us when or where or by whom it was first produced
in a manufactured form. It was rock-salt which the
Egyptians procured from the salt basin of the Sahara,
and rock-salt from the margin of the Red Sea was the
variety that is referred to by the compilers of Biblical
history. But, although the natural crude product was
probably the sole form in which it was known in the
Western world by the Ancients, and through the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
vaunted golden epochs of Babylon, Byzantium, and
Greece, the Chinese—who had invented explosives
before the Romans had perfected the catapult, and had
learnt to navigate by the compass while yet the mariners
of the Mediterranean were dependent upon the stars
and their wits—had probably been familiar for ages
with a salt manufactured by a process, the origin of
which they had forgotten, but the practice of which
was to remain in operation, almost without revision, for
further thousands of years.</p>

<p>The first mention of salt in the Chinese language is
found in the annals of the Emperor Yu (2205–2197 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>),
who ordered the province of Shantung to supply the
Court with that commodity. During the Chow dynasty
(1122–249 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>) the administration of the salt industry
was conducted by Court officials, but the Crown monopoly
of salt was not instituted until the days of
Kuan Chung, who died 645 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Between <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 561 and
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 583, references to various taxes on salt lead us
to the conclusion that salt was produced at that period
from sea-water, salt marshes, and salt springs, and at
the present day salt is produced in China in three
varieties—sea-salt, lake-salt, and well-salt. As the
success of the boiling operation (which antedated by
unnumbered centuries the comparatively modern industry
of extracting salt from sea-water by evaporation in
the sun) depends mainly on the condition of the brine
and the time allowed in each stage of the process, the
details were the subject of many series of experiments
in the pursuit of the perfect system, but since about
the twelfth century the following method has been
consistently followed by the Chinese salt-makers. The
whole of the sea-shore in the neighbourhood of the
salt works is measured out and divided into a number
of small, regular squares; the surface layer in each is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
dug out; the bottom of each pit thus formed is then
strewn with straw, and the earth that has been removed
is thrown back upon it. When these brine ovens, as
they were called—which are shaped like chests, 9 ft.
long, 2 ft. broad, and 3 ft. deep—are prepared, they
are soaked with sea-water. The sea-water in the
interior of the ovens forms brine, and flows through
little ditches into wells which have been dug for its
reception. From these wells, which are about 8 ft.
deep, the brine is drawn out and carried to the boiling
ovens. These brine ovens are furnished with large
evaporating pans, three to five of which are attached to
each oven. The boiling takes place at once and is
continued without interruption, from 11 p.m. until 10.30
on the following morning, and during this period the
salt is taken out six times. As soon as the salt begins
to harden, pods of the <em>tsao-chio</em>  tree are thrown into
the pans, in order that the particles of salt may
combine more quickly, and as soon as it is precipitated,
it is removed and the pans are refilled with fresh brine.
On an average, 600 cathés of the best brine yield 140
cathés of pure salt, which is produced in three qualities
and colours—white, dark, and yellow. The white is the
best, the dark is less esteemed, and the yellow, which
is much inferior, has a bitter taste.</p>

<p>Since the fifteenth century, the Chinese have produced
salt by solar evaporation of salt water, according
to a simple but satisfactory process. Pits are dug on
the sea-shore and bamboos are laid crosswise over
them. The whole is covered with double mats, and
sand is strewn over the top. Every morning and
evening the covering of sand is soaked with sea-water
by the tide, and the salt liquor finds its way into the
pits. As soon as the water has receded, the salt workers
appear with flaming bundles of straw, to test the saline<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
character of the moisture, which is not regarded as
fully impregnated unless the salt vapour arising from
the pits extinguishes the fire. The brine thus produced
is drawn off and run into secondary or crystallizing
ponds, the level of which is set a foot or so below the
first series of pits. The secondary ponds, which are
smaller and of less depth, are provided with carefully-rolled,
hard clay bottoms. When a sufficiently thick
crystalline deposit has been formed at the bottom of
the secondary ponds, workmen, starting at the centre,
scrape the bottoms, working outward spirally and
finishing at the corner of the pond, where the coarse
crystalline product is collected and allowed to drain.
When drained and dried, the salt is ready for transfer
to the market.</p>

<p>In Japan, where the manufacture of sea-salt by
boiling or by spontaneous evaporation was introduced
more than two thousand years ago, the process is
similar to that employed in China, but in some parts
of the kingdom the evaporation basin generally employed
in solar evaporation is dispensed with. In the latter
method, a level field is formed close to the sea and
sprinkled over with fine sand. Sea-water is then
poured into the field, and, after evaporation of the
water, the salt crystallizes and adheres to the sand.
The mixture of salt and sand is next thrown into a
kind of extracting apparatus and sea-water is poured
upon it, whereupon the salt is dissolved and filtered
in the form of a thick salt liquid. In other Japanese
salt fields the concentrated liquor is poured into a
crystallization basin prepared for the purpose, and,
upon evaporation of the water by the sun’s heat, the
salt crystallizes.</p>

<p class="clear">In Italy most of the salt is made by solar evaporation.
The salt grounds, which occupy extensive areas, are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
furnished with reservoirs for the preparation of the sea-water
by saturation and for the deposit of salt. The
former are known as condensers and the latter as crystallizing
beds, and in both the work is carried on by solar
evaporation only. Every salt-ground, or salt-garden,
as it is called, has a feeding channel for the inflow of
sea-water, a drainage channel, and a network of internal
channels at low and high levels, as are required for
immission or drainage purposes. In Portugal and Spain,
salt is made by solar evaporation from sea-water, and
although there are differences between the several
methods, they apply only to details regarding the areas
of the salt-grounds or the sizes of the reservoirs.</p>

<p>Let it be clearly understood that all commercial salt
is produced either from the sea or from rock-salt.
Sea-water is evaporated to precipitate its salt either
by the heat of the sun or by artificial heat. Rock-salt
is mined and refined for market purposes, and it is
resolved into brine from which the salt is extracted by
solar heat or the process of boiling, but whether the
salines are obtained from salt lakes or from natural
brine springs, or are prepared by flooding salt deposits
with water and pumping it out in the form of fully
saturated brine, rock-salt is the foundation for them all.
And in all the processes of manufacture the basic
principle is the same, and consists of applying heat to
drive off the liquid which contains the salt and collecting
the crystalline deposit which remains.</p>

<p>The principle of what is described as the boiling
process is fundamental and unalterable, and for
thousands of years the plant and utensils employed in
the process underwent no material change. Since the
sixteenth century in England, variations in the shape,
size, and capacity of the pans have been introduced,
and experiments have been made in the re-arrangement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
of the receptacles and redistribution of the furnaces,
while coal fuel has been substituted for straw and
wood, but it is only in the past twenty-five years that
any material success has been achieved in the matter
of economizing and accelerating the process of production,
controlling the heat in order to regulate the grain
of the salt, producing more than one grade of salt in one
operation, or of automatically and continuously
collecting the salt as it is precipitated from the brine.</p>

<p>The earliest exact and detailed description that we
have of salt-making appears in <cite xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">De Re Metallica</cite>, a
famous work by Georgius Agricola, of Saxony, which
was published in 1556, and which for the following 180
years, remained the standard text-book on mining and
metallurgy. In Chapter XII of this work, the preparation
of which occupied Agricola for a quarter of a
century, he gives the exhaustive particulars relating to
the boiling process from which the ensuing account is
compiled.</p>

<p>After explaining the method by which sea-water is
received into the first series of prepared trenches, in
which the first stage of evaporation takes place and is
thereafter carried into the second basins, where it is
thickened by further evaporation to the constituency
in which it is ready to be converted into salt, Agricola
tells us that the liquor is then boiled in pans placed
in sheds arranged for the purpose. Each shed is
divided into three parts. In the first part is stored
the firewood or straw, and in the second is the fireplace
on which is placed the caldron. To the right of the
caldron is a tub for the brine that is to be converted
into salt, and on the left is a bench upon which the
salt is placed before being removed to the third compartment,
where it is moulded into cones or tablets and
left to dry in the warm air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span></p>

<p>The fireplaces are made 8½ ft. long and 7¾ ft. wide;
if wood is burned in them they are nearly 4 ft. high,
but if straw fuel is used, they are 6 ft. in height. The
caldrons are rectangular, 8 ft. long and 7 ft. wide, and
6 in. deep. They are made of sheets of iron or lead,
“not very thick so that the water is heated more
quickly by the fire and is boiled away rapidly.” To
prevent the brine from leaking out at the points where
the metal plates are fastened with rivets, the caldrons
are smeared over with a cement of ox-liver, or ox-blood,
mixed with ashes. As soon as the first dipperful of
brine is poured from the brine tub into the caldron,
the wood or straw is ignited in the fireplace. If the
firewood consists of faggots or brushwood, the salt
will be white, but if straw is burned the salt is not
infrequently blackish from the sparks which rise with
the smoke and settle upon the water.</p>

<p>In order to accelerate the condensation of the brine,
the salt-maker adds and mixes into it bullock’s blood,
or calf’s blood, or buck’s blood, which dissolves and is
distributed into all the corners of the caldron. When
the boiling water seems to be mixed with scum, it is
skimmed with a ladle, and from the firing of the furnace
to the skimming of the boiling scum is the work of
half an hour. After this it boils down for another
quarter of an hour, and thereafter it begins to condense
into salt. When the brine commences to thicken with
the heat, it is stirred assiduously with a wooden spatula,
and then allowed to boil for an hour. At this stage
beer is added to the contents of the caldron, which is
protected from the wind by boards, and the salt is
then withdrawn with a shovel and thrown into baskets.
The remaining brine is allowed to boil for another
three-quarters of an hour, when the salt is again
removed and placed in the drying compartment. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
this manner the salters alternately boil the brine and
collect the salt, “day and night, with the exception
only of the annual feast days.” No caldron is able
to stand the fire for more than half a year. New
caldrons are washed out three times in the first two
weeks, and afterwards once a week. In this manner
the incrustations fall from the bottom of the caldron,
and if this is not done the salt would have to be made
more slowly over a fiercer fire, which not only requires
more brine but burns the plates of the caldron. If
any cracks make their appearance in the caldron,
they are filled up with cement. The salt made during
the first two weeks in a new caldron is usually inferior
in quality, being stained by the rust at the bottom
where incrustations have not yet adhered.</p>

<p>Agricola’s description is full of technical exactness
in regard to those parts of the apparatus and the
process which are of comparatively insignificant interest,
but it is, unfortunately, silent about details on which
fuller information would be useful. He tells us the
capacity of the tubs in which the brine is conserved,
but not of the caldrons in which it is boiled, and we
cannot calculate the quantity by the dimensions of
the receptacles, since he omits to mention the depth
to which they are filled. He explains that it takes
half an hour to fill the baskets with the salt that
is drawn from the caldron, but as he does not give us
the dimensions of the baskets employed, or the amount
of wood or straw consumed, we cannot determine the
length of time required to make a certain quantity of
salt, or the cost in fuel. But, condensed and simplified
by the elimination of extraneous particulars and complex
technicalities, the foregoing enables us to obtain
a fair idea of the methods employed by the salter of
Halle, in Saxony, assisted by his wife as helper and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
youthful stoker—working naked, on account of the
great heat, save for a straw cap and a breech cloth—in
the first half of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>The subject of the formation of rock-salt deposits
will be treated in a later chapter, in which a description
will be given of rock-salt mining in Cheshire. The
primitive methods that characterized the brine industry
have been adhered to with equal tenacity in the winning
of rock-salt. It is extraordinary that, in the manufacture
and in the mining of salt, each successive
generation of salt-men, in inheriting their methods from
their forefathers, or adapting them from the miners
of another country, have always preserved the intense
conservatism that appears to be inseparable from the
industry, and have resisted all innovations that have
promised to simplify or expedite their labours.</p>

<p class="clear">It would be an interminable and unprofitable undertaking
to conduct the reader upon a tour of the salt
mines of the world, and explain the different methods
that are adopted to conform with the local and geological
conditions which obtain in the various salt regions.
The systems followed in most countries are governed
by traditions that have their origin in immemorial
times, and the disposition to perpetuate the operations
without change through succeeding ages is, perhaps,
traceable to the races that work the mines rather than
to the deposits in which they work. The process of
solar evaporation which is employed to-day on the
shores of the Mediterranean and the Adriatic is practically
the same as it was when the civilization of China
was in its infancy; the implements and methods in
present use in the salt mines of Austria, Russia, and
Rumania were introduced by the discoverers of the
lodes in the darkest ages. We cannot even fix the
comparatively recent period in which it was decreed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
that the Rumanian mines of Tirgu-Ocna and Ocnele-Mari
should be exploited by convict labour, while the
Slavic mine was to find employment for free workers
only. Every country, every salt district, and almost
every mine has its peculiar and distinguishing rules,
customs, and methods of work, which are interesting
in themselves but of insufficient importance to warrant
detailed consideration in a treatise of this scope. There
are, however, certain salt regions and mines which, by
reason of their magnitude and the possession of unprecedented
features, have obtained rank among the lesser
wonders of the world, and for this reason we must
devote a little space to “the Great Salt” of Wieliezka,
in Hungary, and to the great Rumanian salt deposits.</p>

<p>The famous mines of Wieliezka, in the lower Carpathians,
about eight miles from the city of Cracow—with
their underground roads, houses, and monuments;
their churches, ball-rooms, and restaurants; their lakes,
bridges, and railway stations—constitute a city commemorative
of the art and industry of bygone periods,
and present a spectacle, weird and splendid, that
reminds one of the marvels of the Thousand-and-One
Nights. The Wieliezka system, which has been in
operation since the thirteenth century, extends over
an area of about twelve square miles, and reaches a
maximum depth of some 12,000 ft. The various
galleries at present accessible have an aggregate length
of 65 miles, and the total length of mining railways
is about thirty miles. Each mine consists of five storeys.
The first storey is about 200 ft. below the surface, and
between the different storeys a body of earth or salt
from 80 ft. to 100 ft. thick is left. As in Northwich,
many of the old workings in Wieliezka have fallen in,
and whole chambers and streets have been engulfed
in the holes. Broad staircases connect the various<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
storeys, each of which boasts its distinctive chambers
and thoroughfares. The air in the upper levels is much
more moist than in the lower excavations, with the
result that the salt statues in these apartments are
gradually losing their shape. The head of one is
nearly gone, the arms of another are wasted; while
the deeper furrows, which are observable upon the
sculptured bodies, give them a grotesque appearance.
The smoke of lamps and wicks adds to the moisture
of the air and darkens the surface of the statues, which
might be carved in black marble. Onward and downward
one proceeds, the stairways appear to be innumerable;
the visitor loses all sense of depth, distance, and
direction; chambers and passages lead to further
chambers and passages, until the tour of the workings
leaves one with a dominating impression of limitless
repetition. Everything is of solid salt, except where
some insecure roof is supported by huge timbers or a
wooden bridge is thrown over some vast chasm. As
depth is attained the air grows drier and purer, and
the points and faces of the rock become more crystalline
and beautiful. Onward and downward still, through
labyrinths of shafts, galleries, and chambers, up crooked
passages, and under vaulted archways, that lead into
innumerable, unnamed smaller apartments.</p>

  <div class="caption">WIELIEZKA SALT MINES, GALICIA. THE BEAUTIFUL FRANCIS JOSEPH BALL ROOM, MADE
OF SALT. THE CHANDELIERS ARE MADE OF POLISHED SALT CRYSTALS</div></div>

<p>Groups and gangs of miners, naked to the hips, are
everywhere busy with pick, mallet, and wedge, with
which they block out and separate the salt slabs from
the solid mass. The process has the simplicity of the
age in which it was first employed. The blocks are
marked out on the surface of the rock by grooves.
One side is then deepened to the required thickness,
and the face is split off by wedges inserted under the
block. It is then divided into pieces of 100 lb. each
and removed to the shafts, where it is hoisted, stage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
after stage, to the surface. The number of labourers
continually engaged is from one to two thousand.
The miners, who are muscular, healthy-looking men,
are divided into gangs. The work is carried on in
shifts of six hours each, and in each shift a gang will
quarry out about 1,000 lb. weight of salt.</p>

<p>The Letow ball-room, which lies at a depth of 216 ft.
below the surface, dates from 1750, and has been the
scene of many Royal visits and splendid entertainments.
One end of the spacious chamber is adorned
with a colossal Austrian eagle, and in an alcove at the
opposite end is set up a crystal throne. The giant
chamber which bears the name of Michalowice, a fearsome
and stupendous excavation, was completed in
1701, as the result of forty years of continuous labour.
It is 59 ft. long by 92 ft. broad, and the roof, supported
by a wooden framework, has a height of 118 ft. The
chamber is lit by a salt chandelier furnished with 300
electric bulbs. The Francis Joseph ball-room is another
of the wonders of this subterranean city. It is an
immensely large and immensely lofty apartment, lit
by six large chandeliers fashioned of crystalline rock-salt.
Salt statues of Vulcan and Neptune, which adorn the
hall, reflect the electric light from myriad brilliant
points and angles, and contribute to the general
impression of flashing splendour which the scene
conveys. Beneath these great reception rooms, are
smaller halls, each beautiful in itself, bearing the
names of royal or princely personages. Massive pyramids
of salt and sculptured monuments, with carved
inscriptions, perpetuate the memories of Emperors and
Empresses of Austria, or commemorate their visits to
the mines. Near to the Letow ball-room is the celebrated
St. Anthony’s Chapel, which was hewn in 1698, and
for upwards of two centuries has been the resort of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
thousands of the devout. The vestibule in the chapel
consists of a symmetrical archway with figures at the
sides. The interior is beautified by an altar bearing a
sculptured representation of the Crucifixion, and
flanked by salt effigies of kneeling monks. Hard by
St. Anthony’s Chapel a magnificent shrine is hewn in
one of the passages, peopled with figured saints, which
leads to the Queen’s Chapel, with the superbly-chiselled
altar and its view of Bethlehem carved in the solid salt.</p>

<p>The central railway station in the third storey, and
the great restaurant, with its ponderous pillars and its
long vista of latticed galleries, are among the many
marvels of the mines, but nothing it contains is so
wonderful as the subterranean lake, lying 700 ft. below
the surface of the earth. The waters of the lake are
dark, thick, and heavy, and as the boat glides over
its surface the slumberous wavelets roll up against the
sides of the grotto with a ghost-like swish. A ponderous
solitude over weighs all. The Styx alone of all the
legendary rivers of death could rival this in stillness.
The boat is guided through the Stephanie and Rudolf
grottoes by ropes running on pulleys along the sides of
the curious craft, and the boatman, with his hands
resting on the stern, pushes it with his feet braced
against the rope. Of the sixteen lakes in different
parts of the mine, this is the only one upon which
visitors are allowed to go. The report of a gun fired
in the centre of the lake fills the vault with long and
lingering echoes, and the voice of the boatman sounds
like a giant’s voice uprising from the depths of chaos.</p>

<p>The illumination of the mine is arranged according
to a regular tariff based on the number of visitors
sharing the expense. For any number of persons up
to twenty, the illumination, which comprehends the
employment of over a thousand candles and electric<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
lamps, costs about ninety shillings, but for an additional
sovereign, which is charged when a party numbers
over thirty persons, the whole mine becomes a blaze
of light.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>INTERIOR OF SALT MINE AT SLANICU, RUMANIA</p>

<p>This famous mine has been worked since the time of the Romans.</p></div></div>

<p>Serious calamities at Wieliczka are now practically
unknown, owing to the care exercised by the officials,
but minor accidents are unavoidable. Some few years
ago a huge mass of rock-salt, weighing some 200 tons,
fell from the roof of one of the chambers; in 1868 the
mines were flooded by the bursting of a subterranean
salt lake; and a fire in 1815 resulted in the loss of several
hundred lives. The early history of the mines contains
the record of several terrible disasters, including an
incendiary fire in 1510, which caused a great number
of deaths, and another fire in 1644, which raged for
over a year, and consumed all the people, horses, and
mules who were in the mine when the fire occurred.</p>

<p>The working of the three great Rumanian salt deposits
present other examples of the persistent survival of
ancient methods, but it must be admitted that an
attempt was made at one time to introduce modern
machinery. It was demonstrated that the machine
produced more salt in a given time, and that the waste
of about 25 per cent. of the salt attendant upon manual
labour and the use of picks was saved, but as the
supply of salt is practically inexhaustible, and there is
no limit set upon the time of winning it, and as man-power,
especially convict man-power, is cheaper than
machinery, the authorities soon reverted to the old
system. In the Slanic mine, in which the salt is
crystalline, white, and almost absolutely pure, the free
labourers, of whom about 500 are employed, are divided
into gangs of six men. Each man takes an oblong piece
of the floor of the mine, about as big as an ordinary
tombstone, and, using his pick, scoops round it a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
narrow groove about 5 in. deep. This done, he summons
the rest of his gang, and, standing beside him
on the slab, they raise and bring down their picks
simultaneously at the word of command. Force is
necessary, but rhythmical accuracy in the planting of
the blow is more essential, and by long practice the
men have become so extraordinarily expert that they
scarcely ever diverge a hair’s breadth from the point
at which they aim. In a few minutes the persistent
blows detach the slab, which the six men raise with
the aid of a lever. The gang proceed from slab to slab
until all six have been detached and lifted, after which
each man breaks his own slab into chunks and loads
it into a truck for removal to the shaft, through which
it is hauled to the surface. An expert miner’s earnings
at this work range from half a crown to three shillings
a day.</p>

<p>The convicts employed in the Tirgu-Ocna and Ocnele-Mari
mines are paid from sixpence to eightpence a day
for their work, and, save that liberty and the hospitality
of the local taverns are denied them, their condition
is little worse than that of the free labourers. As
capital punishment does not obtain in Rumania, the
convict miners include murderers, brigands, and the
worst class of criminals, and armed soldiers escort
them to and fro between the prison and the mine, and
remain on guard while they are at work. Dashes for
liberty used to be common, and organized attempts to
escape have also been attempted, but now, on the
first sign of suspicious behaviour on the part of the
convicts, the order is given for the whole gang to
throw themselves flat upon the ground. As those who
disobey the order are immediately shot, instantaneous
compliance with the command is usually observed.
On one occasion a body of disaffected convicts had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
recourse to a form of passive resistance, and when the
day’s work was over they refused to leave the mine.
The guards and overseers thereupon withdrew and left
the mutineers to reflect in an intolerably salt atmosphere
upon the virtues of fresh water, of which they had no
supply. After two days of torture, the men capitulated.
But the work of superintending the convicts in the
mines is a delicate and dangerous task. The overseers
are compelled to mix with the men, and it is but the
work of a few silent minutes for a gang to overpower
an unpopular official and squeeze the breath out of his
body. As the murder is a communal affair, and the
practice of making an example of one man <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pour
l’encourager les autres</i> is not adopted in Rumania, the
extent of punishment inflicted upon the whole gang is
less than would be meted out to individual offenders.
As the salt reserves in the three principal mines of
Rumania are estimated at 8,774,000,000 tons, and the
annual extraction has never exceeded 150,000 tons, it
follows that, at the present rate of progress, the deposits
cannot be exhausted for several millenniums.</p>

<p>Where the salt deposits are composed of a mineral
that is white, odourless, and practically pure, as in
the Wieliezka system and the mines of Rumania, and
particularly if labour is abundant and cheap, and the
industry is a monopoly of the State, rock-salt mining
will always hold its own.</p>

  <div class="caption">WIELIEZKA SALT MINES, GALICIA. THE RAILWAY STATION ON THE THIRD LEVEL</div></div>

<p>Even in this country, when the old open-pan system
of evaporating salt from brine produced only two tons
of salt for the consumption of a ton of fuel, rock-salt
could be raised, purified, and marketed in competition
with white salt, but the modern boiling processes have
effected such substantial improvements and consequent
economical advantages, that the rock-salt industry
appears to be doomed to decay. Rock-salt, as quarried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
from its native bed, is found in many variations of
colour, from grey and yellow to green and brick red,
according to the nature of the impurities of the locality
in which the deposit lies, and such salt must be cleansed
from all traces of iron, clay, gypsum, or bitumen before
it is fit for domestic use. Many processes have been
experimented with for the removal of impurities. One
of the most plausible methods was based on the fact
that salt fuses at a temperature of about 1,750 degrees,
and the theory was to remove all impurities from the
fluid mass by the agency of compressed air. The
principle was unsuccessfully experimented with in
Würtemberg nearly half a century ago, but a modern
adaptation of the process claimed to be more successful.
The molten material, in this case, ran into rotating
pans and gradually overflowed; and it was then shovelled
into another receptacle and, while subjected to the
action of compressed air, raised by small buckets to
a certain height and emptied into inclined screens,
through which it was automatically graded. It was
claimed that from the time of casting the crude material
into the furnace, until the perfect white salt appeared,
the process occupied only fifteen minutes, and that
rock-salt could be broken in the mine, transported,
fused, and packed ready for table use in less than
two hours.</p>

<p>At the time when the master-patent for this process
was taken out, the latest brine-evaporating systems
were unperfected, and there was some possibility that
the invention might be capable of taking the rock-salt
direct from the mine, eliminating at one stroke all its
impurities, and in the course of an hour or two delivering
into the warehouse an anhydrous salt “at a fraction
of the cost of the ordinary process” of evaporating salt
from brine. But by the time that this bold claim was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
put forward on behalf of the process, the admitted
total cost of production had been advanced from 4s.
to 5s. 8d. per ton, while the latest patent brine-evaporating
system was producing the manufactured article
at a total inclusive cost of 3s. 6d. per ton. Since
then, this rock process was installed in Mexico, persevered
with for a while, and finally discarded because, in the
words of Mr. W.&#160;L. Bonney, the United States Consul,
“the experiment proved a failure.” Even if the latest
brine process has not “relegated rock-salt mining into
the limbo of extinct enterprises,” it appears certain
that it will never be able to be worked in competition
with the process by which salt is manufactured direct
from brine where brine is available.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="toclink_32">CHAPTER III<br>

<span class="subhead">THE CHESHIRE WICHES</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">If</span> we turn from the study of salt as one of the staples
of world industry to the history of the salt industry
in England, we find that it is practically comprised in
the records of the development of the trade in rock-salt
and brine in the county of Cheshire. The first
documentary reference to the existence of saline deposits
in this country, as well as the earliest mention of the
method of native manufacture and of the introduction
of the open-pan system of salt-making, dates from the
time of the Roman occupation. The Caesarean soldiers,
who penetrated as far north as the Northwich district,
found the people obtaining salt by the process of
pouring brine upon faggots of charcoal and scraping
away the resultant crystalline formation. A little
spring which existed at that period in Sheath Street,
Northwich, furnished the Romans with a limited supply
of brine, and from this source, with the crude plant
improvised on the spot, they produced the first salt
ever manufactured in England by the boiling of brine
in open pans.</p>

<p>The Britons named the brine spring at Nantwich
“Hellath Wen,” or the White Pit, on account of the
whiteness of the salt produced from its waters; while
the spring at Northwich received the name of “Hellath
Du,” or the Black Pit. The suffix “wich” may have
been introduced into Cheshire direct from the Vikings
of the North, or brought there by way of the south-eastern
counties. In Camden’s <cite>Britannia</cite> (published
in Latin in 1607, and translated by Philemon Holland,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
1610), we read that the word Wiccij “may seeme to
have beene derived of those <em>salt pittes</em>  that the old
Englishmen in their language named <em>Wiches</em> ,” and
William Smith, a Cheshire Man and author of a work
which is known as King’s <em>Vale Royal</em>  (1656 edition),
says: “The house in which the salt is boiled is called
the Wychhouse; whence may be guessed what <em>wych</em>
signifies, and why all those towns where there are
salt-springs or salt made are called by the name of
<em>wych</em> , viz., <em>Namptwych</em> , <em>Northwych</em> , <em>Middlewych</em> , <em>Droitwych</em> .”
But the Norse word <em>wig</em>  and the Anglo-Saxon
<em>wic</em>  signified, in the original, a dwelling-place, and
in the latter form of <em>wich</em> , it is seen in the names of
Woolwich, Norwich, Harwich, Sandwich, etc. The
Norse and Danish pirates who visited our coasts to
pillage and procure salt, established <em>wigs</em> —afterwards
wiches or hamlets—on the bays and inlets, and wherever
they located themselves they proceeded to make bay-salt.
The word <em>wich</em> , in course of time, became identified
not with the village but with the salt manufacture
that was carried on there, and when the Cheshire towns
developed the industry they may easily have adopted
the nomenclature that was already regarded as indicative
of the manufacture.</p>

<p>In the records of Droitwich, which was also called
Durt-wich “by reason of the wettish ground on which
it stands,” we learn that in the year 816, Kenulph,
King of the Mercians, gave Hamilton and ten houses
in Wich together with their salt-furnaces, to the church
of Worcester, and that in 906 the same church was
endowed by Edwy, King of England, with Fepstone
and five salt-furnaces; but the next earliest references
to the Cheshire Wiches must be searched for among
the entries in Domesday Book, which was prepared
between 1084 and 1086. William the Conqueror’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
authorized inquiry as to the several places in which
salt was being made, and the persons who had held
proprietorial rights in them since the time of Edward
the Confessor, was productive of much detailed information.
From the zincograph reproduction of the original
made by Mr. William Beaumont in 1863, it would
appear that the Cheshire brine-springs and salt works
were strictly held, and were subject to certain well-defined
customs. In several localities the existence of
solitary salt-houses is mentioned, and it would seem
safe to infer that the supply of brine was obtained in
the vicinity and the salt was only made for local consumption.
Salt-making for commercial purposes was
confined to Nantwich, in Warmundestron Hundred,
and Northwich and Middlewich in the Hundred of
Mildestvic, and, although no figures relating to output
or revenues are given, the laws governing the trade,
the prices charged, and the method of dividing the
moneys accruing from rents and sales are concisely set
forth in the following <span class="locked">paragraphs—</span></p>

<p>“Mildestvic hundred. Hugh and William held of
the Earl Rode Godric and Ravesa held it for two manors
and were free men.”</p>

<p>“In the same hundred of Mildestvic there was a
third Wich called Norwich (Northwich), which was in
farm at eight pounds. In it there were the same laws
and customs as in the other Wiches, and the King and
the Earl divided the receipts in the like manner. All
the thanes who held salt-houses in this Wich gave no
Friday’s boilings of salt the year through. Whoever
brought a cart, with two or more oxen, from another
shire, gave 4 pence for the toll. A man from the same
shire gave for his cart 2 pence within the third night
after his return home. If he allowed the third night
to pass, he was fined 40 shillings. A man from another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
shire paid 1 penny for a horse load. But a man from
the same shire paid 1 styca within the third night
after his return, as aforesaid. A man living in the same
hundred, if he carted salt about through the same
county to sell, gave a penny for every cart, for as many
times as he loaded it. If he carried salt on a horse to
sell, he gave 1 penny at Martinmas. Whoso did not
pay it at that time was fined 40 shillings. All the
other customs in the Wiches are the same. This manor
was waste when Earl Hugh received it. It is now
worth 35 shillings.”</p>

<p>“<i>Nantwich.</i>—In King Edward’s time there was a
Wich in Warmundestron hundred, in which there was
a well for making salt, and between the King and
Earl Edwin there were 8 salt-houses, so divided that of
all their issues and rents the King had two parts and
the Earl the third. But besides these, the Earl had
one salt-house adjoining his manor of Acatone (Acton)
which was his own. From this salt-house the Earl had
sufficient salt for his house throughout the year. But
if he sold any from thence, the King had twopence, and
the Earl a third penny, for the toll. In the same Wich
many men from the country had salt-houses, of which
this was the <span class="locked">custom—</span></p>

<p>“From our Lord’s Ascension to Martinmas, anyone
having a salt-house might carry home salt for his own
house. But if he sold any of it either there, or elsewhere
in the county of Chester, he paid toll to the
King and the Earl. Whoever after Martinmas carried
away salt from any salt-house except the Earl’s, under
his custom aforesaid, paid toll, whether the salt was
his own or purchased. These aforesaid 8 salt-houses
of the King and the Earl, in every week that salt was
boiled or they were used on a Friday, rendered 16
boilings of salt, of which 15 made a horse-load. From<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
our Lord’s Ascension to Martinmas, the salt-houses of
the other men did not give these Friday’s boilings.
But from Martinmas to our Lord’s Ascension, these
boilings were given according to custom, as from the
salt-houses of the King and the Earl. All these salt-houses,
both of the lord and other people, were surrounded
on one part by a certain river, and on the
other part by a ditch. Whosoever committed a forfeiture
within these bounds, might make amends, either
by the payment of 2 shillings, or by 30 boilings of salt,
except in the case of homicide, or of a theft, for which
the thief was adjudged to die. These last, if done here,
were dealt with as in the rest of the shire. If out of
the prescribed circuit of the salt-houses, any person
within the county withheld the toll, and was convicted
thereof, he brought it back and was fined 40 shillings,
if a free man; or if not free, 4 shillings. But if he
carried the toll into another shire, where it was demanded
the fine was the same. In King Edward’s time, this
Wich, with all pleas in the same hundred, rendered
21 pounds in farm. When Earl Hugh received it,
except only one salt-house, it was waste. William
Maldebeng now holds of the Earl the same Wich, with
all the customs thereto belonging, and all the same
hundred, which is rated at 40 shillings, of which 30
shillings are put on the land of the said William, and
10 shillings on the land of the Bishop, and the lands of
Richard and Gilbert which they have in the same
hundred, and the Wich is let to farm at 10 pounds.”</p>

<p>“<i>Middlewich.</i>—In Mildestvich hundred there is
another Wich between the King and the Earl. There,
however, the salt-houses were not the lord’s, but they
had the same laws and customs that have been mentioned
in the above-mentioned Wich, and the customs
were divided between the King and the Earl in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
same manner. This Wich was let to farm for 8 pounds
and the hundred wherein it was, for 40 shillings. The
King had two parts, and the Earl the third. When
Earl Hugh received it, it was waste. The Earl now
holds it, and it is let to farm for 25 shillings, and two
wain-loads of salt. But the hundred is worth 40
shillings. From these two Wiches, whoever carried
away bought salt in a wain drawn by four oxen or
more, paid 4d. for the toll; but if by two oxen, 2 pence
if the salt were two horse-loads. A man from another
hundred gave 2d. for a horse-load. But a man of the
same hundred gave only a halfpenny for a horse-load.
Whoever loaded his wain so that the axle broke within
a league of either Wich, gave 2 shillings to the King’s
or the Earl’s officers, if he were overtaken within the
league. In like manner, he who loaded his horse, so
as to break its back, gave 2 shillings if overtaken
within the league, but nothing if overtaken beyond it.
Whoever made two horse-loads of salt out of one, was
fined 40 shillings if the officers overtook him. If he
was not found, nothing was to be exacted from any
other. Men on foot from another hundred buying salt,
paid 2d. for eight men’s loads. Men of the same
hundred paid 1d. for the same number of such loads.”</p>

<p>The first private record relating to salt appears in
the foundation deed of Combermere Abbey, dated
1132, in which Hugh Malbane, the founder, caused it
to be written: “And I also grant to the same monks
the fourth part of the town of Wych, and tythe of my
salt and of the salt pits that are mine, and salt of
Blessed Mary the Virgin, and salt on Friday, and salt
for the Abbot’s table as freely as I have it at my table.”</p>

<p>Ancient Deeds in the Record Office contain occasional
reference to salt properties in the thirteenth
and fifteenth centuries which show that salt was made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
in limited quantities in Cambridgeshire and at Rye,
Mimera, and Brembre (formerly Hayerskys), in the
County of Sussex.</p>

<p>Protests against the importation of salt from abroad,
and of salt-making by foreigners contrary to the liberties
and ancient customs of the borough of Northwich, are
recorded in the Harleian MSS. In response to a complaint
made on behalf of the burgesses and inhabitants
of Northwich concerning the mischievous irregularities
committed in the making of salt by “p’sons forrayne
and not inhabiting w/thin the Sḍ towne,” King
Henry VIII issued an Order to the Justice and
Chamberlaine of the County Palatine of Chester to
the effect: “<em>WHEREFORE</em>  we will and command you
that in any case such forrayne p’son or p’sons not
inhabiting within the s/<sup>d</sup> towne, do, or hereafter at
any time shall attempt to use makeing of salt contrary
to the lib/<sup>er</sup>ties and ancient customes of the same within
the same towne without lycence of the burgess and the
rulers thereof. <em>THAT</em>  then without delay ye and ether
of you from tyme to tyme upon complaynt or of the
rulers and govnors of the same towne do send for all
and every such forrayne p’sons as do or hereafter shall
attempt to make any salt within the s/<sup>d</sup> towne of Northwich
contrary to the libties and ancient customes of
the same, without the assent and agreem/<sup>t</sup> of the s/<sup>d</sup>
Burgess and ruler by o/<sup>r</sup> writts of subp: to appear
before you in o/ Castle of Chester at there appearance
to punish and reforme them: And also further to order
them as right and good conscience shall require according
to the lawes and customes heretobefore used now in
other wyches there abts w/<sup>th</sup>in o/<sup>r</sup> s/<sup>d</sup> County Palatyne,
for the reformacon of such transgressions fayle ye not
hereof as ye maye intend to please us.”</p>

<p>In the time of the Tudors, the salt-makers of Cheshire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
were composed of natives and “forrayners,” or residents
born outside the boundaries of the county, and in the
Northwich Book of Orders is given a list of ten “outliers”
in the town of Northwich who occupied between
them no fewer than eighty-nine salt pans or leads.
Although we have no information as to the exact size
and capacity of the evaporating pans of the period, it
is evident that they were made to a regulation scale,
and we read that it was the business of an officer of
the Court Leet to examine the leads and see that they
conformed with the standard dimensions. If the prescribed
measurements were exceeded, the official cut
a piece out of the corner of the pan with a pair of
shears with which he was furnished for the purpose,
so as to reduce its capacity to the legal limit.</p>

<p>Only three of these old salt-pans have been recovered,
and, of these, one was cut up and sold as old lead.
One which was drawn out of the river at Northwich
in 1866 was forwarded by the River Weaver Trustees
to the Warrington Exhibition, and was transferred
subsequently to the Northwich Museum. This pan
measures 3 ft. 8 in. long on one side, and 3 ft. 4½ in.
on the other; it has a width of 2 ft. 8 in., and is 4 in.
deep. The thickness of the lead is about half an inch.
and the weight of the pan is 2 cwt., 1 qr. 18 lb. There
are raised patterns on each end of the pan, which was
evidently cast, and the sides are rounded up from the
bottom. In 1878, in the vicinity of Ashton’s Salt Works
at Witton, was found a smaller pan made out of a
sheet of lead 2 ft. 8 in. square. The sheet was bent
up to form a pan and the corners were hammered
together. This lead is 25 in. square by 3 in. in depth,
and has a capacity of about 7 gallons.</p>

<p>In the early years of the reign of James I we have
particulars of the salt districts in Camden’s <cite>Britannia</cite>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
and in a letter received in February, 1605, from Chomley
written by one George Johnson. Camden explains that
the Cheshire <em>Wiches</em>  were so-called because “there bee
here very notable <em>salt pits</em>  and many salt springs often-time
have been found which notwithstanding are
stopped up, because it was provided (as wee read)
that for the saving of woods, salt should not be boiled
but in certain places.”</p>

  <div class="caption">SUBSIDENCE NEAR THE DANE BRIDGE, NORTHWICH</div></div>

<p>Meagre as these accounts are in exact particulars,
they constitute the only information we have concerning
the supply and treatment of brine in England in the
early days of the industry, and, consequently, they
invite attention. Camden is responsible for the following
<span class="locked">details—</span></p>

<p>“At <i>Northwich</i> there is a deep and plentiful brine
pit with stairs about it, by which, when they have
drawn the water in their leathern buckets, they ascend,
half naked, to their troughs and fill them, from whence
it is conveyed to the wich-houses about which there
stand on every side many stakes and piles of wood.</p>

<p>“<i>Nantwich.</i>—There is but one salt pit here (they
call it the brine pit) distant about 14 ft. from the river.
From this brine pit they convey water by wooden troughs
into the houses adjoining, where there stand ready
little barrels, fixed in the ground, which they fill with
that water; and at the notice of a bell, they presently
make a fire under their leads, whereof they have six
in every house for boiling the water. These are attended
by ‘Wallers’—a name probably derived from the
Anglo-Saxon <em>weallere</em> , a boiler; German, <em>wallen</em> , to boil—who
with little wooden rakes, draw the salt out of the
bottom of them and put it in baskets, out of which the
liquor runs, but the salt remains and settles....</p>

<p>“The depth of the salt springs is in some places not
above three or four yards. In Nantwich the pit is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
full 7 yards (deep) from the footing about the pit:
which is guessed to be the natural height of the ground,
though the bank be 6 foot higher, accidentally raised
by rubbish of long making salt or “walling,” as they
call it. In two places within our Township, the spring
breaks up so in the meadows as to fret away not only
the grass, but part of the earth, which lies like a breach
at least half a foot or more lower than the turf of the
meadow: and hath a salt liquid ousing (oozing) as it
were out of the meed but very gently.</p>

<p>“<i>Droitwich</i> possesses three fountaines yielding
plenty of water to make salt of, divided asunder by a
little brooke of fresh water passing betweene, by a
peculiar gift of nature spring out: out of which most
pure white salt is boiled for six months every yeare,
to wit, from Midsommer to Midwinter, in many set
fornaces round about: wherewith a mighty deal of
wood is consumed, <i>Fakenham Forest</i> (where trees grew
sometime thicker), and the woods round about, if men
hold their peace, will by their thinness, make manifest
more and more....”</p>

<p>Of the two wells of salt-water at <i>Middlewich</i>, which
are separated by a small brook, we are only told that
“one stands not open but at certain set times, because
folke willingly steale the watere thereof, as being of
great vertue and efficacie.”</p>

<p>More informative on essential points is the unknown
correspondent of George Johnson, who writes as
<span class="locked">follows—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">“<i>Namptwich.</i></p>

<p>“There is in the town of Namptwich two hundred
and sixteen salt-houses of six leads apeece, and every of
the said houses doth spend in wood per annum eight
pounds so as there is spent in wood yearly within the
said town in omnibus annis.... £1728</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span></p>

<p class="center">“<i>Middlewich.</i></p>

<p>“There is, in the said town, one hundred and seven
salt houses of six leads apeece, and one of four leads and
every of the said houses doth spend yearly in wood the
sum of £13. 6. 8, so as there is spent every year within
the said town, £1435. 4. 0.</p>

<p class="center">“<i>Northwich.</i></p>

<p>“The said Northwich is a Burrow and holden of the
Earle of Chester by the service of twelve armed men to
serve at the Watergate in Chester in the time of wars
betwixt England and Wales. There is, in the same
towne or Burrow, one hundred and thirteen salt houses,
every one containing four leads apeece, and one odd lead
and one four leads which was given to the Earl of
Derby by the Burgesses, occupiers of the said Town, for
the portion of his house, and no land in the Town for it,
and every four leads must have in provision of wood,
nine quarters and so rateable, whether it be four leads
or six leads, so that there is spent in wood in the said
town 1026 quarters and a peece after the rate of five
score to the hundred and after the rate of forty shillings
per Quarter comes to £2056. 10. Spent in the wich
houses yearly in wood, £5219. 14.”</p>
</div>

<p>The particulars which are given of the salt manufacture
in the Wiches in 1605 and 1607 by George
Johnson’s correspondent and by Camden, are repeated
with only the slightest variation half a century later
in King’s <em>Vale Royal</em> . But in the latter account we
are able to glean a little more information about the
towns themselves. Concerning Northwich, we are told
that it had the mischance to be burnt in July, Anno 1438,
and was “most part miserably consumed with fire,”
in December, 1583. “But through the Benevolence
gathered throughout the Realm, it is new builded, and
is in as good case or rather better than before.” The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
town in 1656 was divided into two parts, one of which
was called the Cross, while a “very fair church of stone,”
called Northwich Church, stood “without the Town’s-end.”
But although it was called Northwich Church,
we are told that it was only a chapel and its proper
name was Witton; a combination of coincidences which
caused the chronicler to conclude “that the town was
named first Northwich, after the finding of the salt.”
Of Nantwich, we are only informed that the town
was visited in 1617 by the gracious King’s Most Excellent
Majestie, who, with his own eyes beheld the manner of
the brine well and the labours of the drawers of brine—who,
in the course of their work, “spend the coldest
day in frost and snow, without any clothing more than
a shirt with great cheerfulnesse”—and “with his own
hand most princely rewarded them.” Middlewich is
described by the same authority as no market town:
“yet may it pass amongst them, as well for the bigness
thereof, as also it hath Burgesses and other privileges,
as the other wiches have, yet it hath a small market of
flesh and other things every Saturday, and yearly two
fairs: that is to say on Ascension Day and St. Luke’s
Day. It hath divers streets and lanes, as King Street,
Kinderton Street, Wich House Street, Lewis Street,
Wheelock Street: Pepper Lane: Cow Lane and Dog
Lane. But the chiefest place of all is a broad place in
the middest of the Town, in manner of a market place,
called the King’s Mexon.”</p>

<p>A large accumulation of matter of great local and
antiquarian interest is to be found in the Northwich
Book of Orders, the Court Rolls, and the Walling Booke
of Northwich, which consist of documents and records
relating to the government of the town and the regulation
of its salt industry about the middle of the
seventeenth century. The “Ancient Customes of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
Burrow and Town of Northwich,” the inventory of
“The Liberties and Priviledges of Burgesses,” and the
Orders “concerning the making of salt,” were collected
and set down by Peter Warburton, of Chester, Esquire,
Steward of Northwich, and afterwards a Justice of the
Court of Common Pleas at Westminster. At a Court
held on 18th December, 1608, this compilation, “so
full of interest and instruction,” was ratified and
confirmed by Thomas Berrington, Gentleman, Steward
of the said Court, and a jury of Burgesses, and Thomas
Poole, Gentleman, Clerk of the said Court, was instructed
to write them into a Booke “to the end the same may
remain upon record to future ages.”</p>

<p>The Nine Customes, numbered 10 to 18, which were
written in 1638, were supplemented in 1641 by other
Nine Customes, numbered 1 to 9, which had been
“heretofore omitted merely through forgetfulness.” Of
the eighty-four Orders relating to salt-making which
appear in these records, the first sixty-one were agreed
upon by “The Steward and Jury at Diverse Courts”
up to 1629, the seven following were added in 1630,
and seven more appeared on the rolls before Master
Poole made a fair copy of the Orders in 1638. In the
following year eight further regulations were issued.
Order No. 84 bears the date of December, 1656, and
only three subsequent unnumbered enactments were
included up to 1666, when the record comes to an end.</p>

<p>Although these old Orders (1629–1666) include directions
relating to the general behaviour of the townspeople,
injunctions concerning the sales of liquor and
butchers’ meat, the malpractices of begging at men’s
doors, piking or stealing wood, “scoulding or chideing
... to the trouble or disquietness of the good and
honest neighbours,” and rules for the maintenance of
cleanliness in the streets and public places and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
publication and preservation of Proclamations put forth
by the King, the bulk of the laws are framed in the
interests of the staple industry of the district. No
detail connected with salt-making, from the drawing of
the brine to the transport of the manufactured product,
is left to chance or the discretion of the individual.
The rights and privileges of Burgesses, and particularly
of such as occupy salt-houses or wallings, are set forth
in the Ancient Customes, but in all particulars relating
to the making of salt, the Orders are paramount and
precise. Space does not permit of the reproduction
here of the whole of the regulations, but a few of the
Items may be quoted as evidence of the care and
thoroughness with which they were framed.</p>

<p>“7. Item. It is ordered that no man shall enter
into the Lead-looker’s book any more walling or occupation
for one Wich-house than six leads walling upon
paine for every offence ... 10s.”</p>

<p>“15. Item. That if any Person or Persons receive
into their Houses any Wood by Night or by day by
the way of Exchange for Candles, Meat or Drink every
such Person as well the Changer as the Receiver shall
pay fine to the Lord for every default 5s. or to be
punished by the Steward.”</p>

<p>“17. Item. That every Waller shall sell the salt
she maketh by the Walme or Cranock and not by the
sack or load, and at the price which the officers sett
down to be the com’on price of the Towne upon pains
for every default 3s. and also to make up the full price
to her Mr. upon her wages.”</p>

<p>“18. Item. That no Waller nor no other Person shall
make any fire in the Wich-house streets in the night
time, and every such offence to be presented by the
Bailiffe at any single Court and punished by the Steward
according to his discretion.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span></p>

<p>“22. Item. That no person shall deliver any bryne
to be carryed out of this Towne either in Hodge heads
or Barrels (except upon Woemen’s heads) upon paine to
forfeit to the Lord for every such offence ... 20s.”</p>

<p>“24. Item. That there should be left at every pile
made at the end of any Wich-house or Wood roome a
yard and a halfe between the said pile and the Crest
of the Pavement to the intent that waynes may have
better passage upon paine of 6s. 8d. presentable at any
single Court.”</p>

<p>“26. Item. It is ordered that no Person from henceforth
shall be suffered to wall or occupy any Odd Lead
as 3, 5 or 7, but 2, 4 or 6 Leads for avoiding of trouble
to the officers except in such case as cannot be remedied
upon paine of ... 10s.”</p>

<p>“27. Item. It is ordered that henceforth no Person
shall occupie Walling unless they first continue a
householder for the space of three years and after such
time expired to be allowed by the Steward or his Deputy,
and the Lead-lookers (except he be a Burgess) upon
paine to forfeit for every lead ... 13s. 4d.”</p>

<p>“33. Item. That all Inhabitants and Occupiers of
the Towne do aide and assist lawfully every Officer of
the Towne in Executing their office lawfully upon paine
every one that offendeth to pay for every offence ... 10s.”</p>

<p>“40. Item. It is ordered that if any Waller be found
making of Course Salt when they might make it better
if they would, the Lead-lookers or Salt-viewers so
finding them and making presentment thereof e’ry such
Waller so offending shall fine to yr Lord for e’ry offence
therein ... 2d.”</p>

<p>“43. Item. We do also order that every Occupiers’
Leads of this town shall henceforth be made Tenn stone
weight a peece to the pan before they be cast, upon paine
of the Lead-casters forfeiture to the Lord of this Towne<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
for every default in casting any Leads contrary to this
order the sum of ... 10s.”</p>

<p>“63. Item. It is also ordered that every occupier
of Walling or his Waller, or his Serv<sup>ts</sup> shall weekly
make cleane ye pavem<sup>t</sup> ag<sup>t</sup> their Wich-Houses one
yard and a half from the middle of the pavement upon
paine to forfeit for every such offence ... 12d.”</p>

<p>Duly set forth in these records are the forms of oaths
to be administered by the Court to those who “shall
well and truly execute the office” of Constable, Lead-looker,
Overseer, Salt-viewer, Assessor, Killer of Salt,
Market Looker, Sealer and Searcher of Leather, Ale-Taster;
Skavinger, Gutter Viewer, Wood Tender, or
Pan Cutter. Each of these important officers in the
prescribed form must “swear by the holy Contents of
this Booke,” to “spare no man for any love, favour or
affection” in the fulfilment of his several duties but
“of all Defaults and Defects that you find in the
execution of yo<sup>r</sup> office you shall present at every Single
Court to be holden after such Default made—So help
you God.”</p>

<p>The compiler of <em>Vale Royal</em>  (1656) does not admit
that he is indebted to the Northwich Book of Orders
for his information, but he alludes in general terms to
the “authentique rules and customes” which regulate
the manner of making salt in the Cheshire wiches, and
adds: “All these things I leave to be read other where,
knowing well their jealous love to be such towards this
their beloved commodity as I should soon incur some
reprehension for being too busie to look narrowly upon
such a beauty.”</p>

  <div class="caption">DUNKIRK SUBSIDENCE, NEAR NORTHWICH</div></div>

<p>In “A Copie of The Walling booke of Northw<sup>ch</sup>,”
amongst the Harleian MSS., the earliest list of occupiers of
wich-houses with the number of leads, together with the
names of such persons as had wich-houses of Inheritance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
in the town, with their number of leads, was compiled
in 1565, and gives a total of “five score and
thirteene Salt houses and one lead.” A list of owners
and of salt-houses arranged in the form of a street
directory was drawn up in 1593, and, about 1600, a
revised list, compiled in accordance with the location
of the houses, and giving the number of leads in each,
was supplemented by a street plan of the town. In the
list of 1589 it is recorded <span class="locked">that—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Our Soveraigne lady the queene hath two salt-houses
of free occupa’ion, and toulfree wth all and
one is Judger of Cogshall.”</p>
</div>

<p>In the list of 1604, the King appears as the owner of
two salt-houses, and it is assumable that His Majesty
acquired an additional half of a salt-house in the
following year, since, in the more detailed compilation
drawn up in 1605, we read <span class="locked">that—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Our Soveraigne Lord the Kings Maj<sup>ty</sup> hath two
Salt-house and a halfe which be both towle free and
ffine free and is Judger of Cockshall.”</p>
</div>

<p>The King’s name as the owner of “2½ towle free and
fine free” salt-houses heads the list for 1619 and that
for 1636–1638. This last contains the names of forty-six
lords and owners of salt-houses, having an aggregate
of over 400 leads.</p>

<p>It was the custom to repeat the legend either at the
beginning or the end of each succeeding list <span class="locked">that—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“There is and tyme out of mynd hath been within
the Towne of Northwich 112 four leads and one odde
lead and noe more; and four leads called the Running
Wich-house. Soe the totall is 113 four leads and
one odde lead.”</p>
</div>

<p>This formula was evidently only a fable. The
discrepancy between the figures and the statement
was pointed out by a scribe in 1630, who, having cast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
up the number of leads tabulated in the list of 1589,
appended the following note: “These leads answere but
unto 308 leads whereas there is 453 leads yearly walled
for ut pateat ante: soe that there wanted 145 leads to
make up the full accoumpt for 308 leads and 145 leads
make but just 453.”</p>

<p>There are about 450 leads accounted for in the next
list, which was drawn up in 1593, but the clerk persisted
in the assumption that what had been “time
out of mynd” could suffer no change, and he formally
declared, despite his own figures to the contrary, that
“the totall some is 113 four leads and one odde lead,
which stand in the Towne rowe as is before written
and declared.”</p>

<p>On folio 61 of one of the Harleian MSS., following the
list of Northwich salt-owners for the years 1636–38, are
undated lists of salt-owners of Middlewich and Nantwich.
The clerk admits the incompleteness of the list of
twenty-two owners in Middlewich, but he explains
that the names he gives are “as manie as I can learne
for the p’sent,” and he adds, “But the number of their
sev’all and respective howses and leads I cannot learne.”
Only five owners appear in the returns for Nantwich,
and the meagre particulars that the clerk has been able
to acquire respecting the other salt districts of Cheshire
are contained in the following note: “There is another
Wiche where there is a great store of Salt made in
Cheshire And w<sup>ch</sup> is of greate Antiquitie called Fulwich,
also Durtwich, and my Lo: Brereton is an owner of
sev’all wich-houses theire. But whoe are owners of the
rest I cannot learne.”</p>

<p>Nantwich was long famous among the Wiches for
its production of the finest and best white salt. The
Welsh named it Hellath Wen, and the <cite>London Magazine</cite>,
in 1750, translated the words as the “White Salt Town,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
but there is no reference to the quality or colour of its
output in the present name, which is derived from the
Welsh word “nant,” a vale, and the Saxon “wyche.”
That its salt was good, plentiful, and of considerable
commercial value would seem to be shown by the fact
that under the Saxons the supplies were in the hands
of the princes and nobles, and William the Conqueror
had not been in England more than a year before he
divided the salt production of Nantwich between
himself and Earl Edwin, who owned some salt-houses
in the district.</p>

<p>According to Leland, there were 400 salt works at
Nantwich in the reign of Henry VIII, but the number
was reduced to 216 under Elizabeth, and in 1624 only
108 were in existence. Nantwich was described in the
<cite>London Magazine</cite> of 1750 as the largest and most
considerable town in the county next to Chester, but
its salt industry at that period was fast declining. An
Act of Parliament which had been obtained in 1734 to
extend the navigation of the river Weaver from Winsford
to Nantwich, was never put into operation. In
1778 the salt works had been reduced to two, each
containing five large pans of wrought iron. The Nantwich
salt industry was practically moribund in 1849,
but some twenty-five tons per week were produced by
one maker until 1856, which is the last year in which
salt was made in the district. In 1891 a company
was registered for the purpose of acquiring property in
Nantwich and manufacturing salt from brine, but the
necessary financial support was not forthcoming and
the project was abandoned. The decline of the Nantwich
salt industry is ascribed in Poole’s <cite>History of Cheshire</cite>
(1778) to various causes, including the frequent destruction
by fire of the works in the town—“fourteen of
which in the memory of persons living lately, having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
been destroyed in one day”; to the discovery and
exploitation of new salt springs in adjacent localities;
and to the superior advantages in the matter of
accessibility which were possessed by Northwich and
Winsford.</p>

<p>Northwich, described by the Welsh as Hellath-du,
became the chief of the Cheshire salt towns in the
seventeenth century, and its output of brine is still
greater than that of any other district. In 1605,
Northwich had 449 leads, against 642 leads at Middlewich
and 1,296 leads at Nantwich, but the comparative
superiority of the brine pumped at Nantwich over that
of her rivals is demonstrated by the relative amount of
boiling required to precipitate the salt. In Northwich,
the annual expenditure for wood fuel was £2,056;
Middlewich, with nearly one-third more leads, consumed
wood fuel to the amount of £1,435 yearly; while Nantwich,
working twice as many leads as Middlewich, and nearly
three times the number operated at Northwich, had an
annual wood bill of only £1,728.</p>

<p>In 1670, Winsford, which had only just started as a
salt producer, had two salt works in operation on a
small scale. In 1675, Lord Brereton ignored the output
of Winsford in his calculation of the total annual salt
production of the Cheshire works at 26,927 tons. In
1878, or practically two centuries later, the Cheshire
output of salt was calculated at 2,055,000 tons, made
up as follows: Winsford and District, 1,036,000 tons;
Northwich and District, 880,000 tons; Middlewich and
District, 21,000 tons; and the newly-developed Sandbach
District, 118,000 tons. But while Winsford has surpassed
her older competitors in the matter of salt
production, Northwich is still the commercial centre
of the industry and the greatest producer of brine;
whereas, in the case of the other districts, the brine is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
converted into salt on the spot, the Northwich brine,
to the amount of hundreds of millions of gallons annually,
is pumped out of the neighbourhood through the
Marbury pipe, to be employed in the chemical works
of Brunner, Mond &amp; Co., and be manufactured into
salt at the Salt Union’s works at Weston Point.</p>

<p>Compared with the other salt-making centres, the
record of Middlewich is of slight importance, and
although the ancient town boasts an honourable place
in the history of the Cheshire Wiches, it now takes a
secondary position among the salt-producing districts.</p>

<p>Lawton, in the south-eastern corner of the Cheshire
salt region, is a comparatively modern entrant into the
local industry, for although the place is of historic
importance as the scene of the discovery of the bottom
bed of salt in 1779, white salt has only been manufactured
there for something over 130 years. The deposits,
which are found at a considerable height above sea-level,
are of great but undefined magnitude, as the lowest
strata has been bored through for a thickness of 72 feet,
without penetrating the formation. The rock salt
here was acknowledged to be purer than any previously
encountered in Cheshire, and the brine derived therefrom,
containing 26·100 chloride sodium by weight,
yields on evaporation an exceptionally high class of white
salt. The Commercial Salt Company, Ltd., which was
formed to work the Hodgkinson Patent Salt-making
Process, to which further reference must be made later,
have their works at Lawton, where they are most
conveniently situated in the important matters of
transport and fuel, being on the canal which brings them
nearer to the markets of the Midland Counties than any
other salt works in the country, and obtaining their
coal from workings within two miles of the property.
The rock salt formation is so vast that the supply of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
brine, if not actually inexhaustible, will allow of an
enormous production of salt for many generations to
come. The output of white salt at Lawton for nearly
a century and a half has not appreciably depleted the
deposits and is not at present being drawn upon, as the
Commercial Salt Company are pumping from an excellent
“brine run” which is pumped without the damage
to property and subsidence of land that have occurred
in other parts of the Cheshire salt districts.</p>

<p>The chronicle of the salt industry of Winsford is one
of the romances of commerce. Until the river Weaver
was made navigable, the Winsford salt manufacture
was limited to the output of only four pans of unrecorded
dimensions, which were probably worked by Middlewich
makers. In 1758, the first year in which the
Winsford shippings were recorded separately, the export
of white salt was 1,055 tons. By the end of the century,
Winsford sent 44,384 tons down the river Weaver, and,
in the year 1850, their shipments had increased to
324,249 tons. This output had risen in 1880 to 794,824
tons of white salt. In the ensuing ten years there was
a slight increase, followed by a sharp decline (in 1890)
to 501,548 tons, or a fall from the high-water mark
of 834,306 tons in 1881, of no less than 332,758 tons.
The decline in the Winsford make of salt was not arrested
by the formation of the Salt Union in 1888, and ten
years later the output of white salt had decreased to
403,455 tons, and the export of rock-salt from Winsford,
which had recommenced with an output of 141 tons
in 1856 and risen to 28,236 tons in 1886, ceased in 1898.</p>

<span class="subhead">DEVELOPMENT OF BRINE PROCESSES</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">It</span> has been said that <cite xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">De Re Metallica</cite> of Georgius
Agricola, published in 1556, was regarded as the standard
text-book on the subject for nearly two centuries, and
in that long period the method he describes of salt-making
by the artificial evaporation of brine underwent
no material change. But from the last half of the
seventeenth century, various attempts were made to
effect improvements in the open-pan process in this
country, and the history of these endeavours is set forth
in a sequence of interesting publications. Among the
most important of these is an article, which was printed
in the <cite>Philosophical Transactions</cite> of the Royal Society
of England, in 1669, in which Dr. William Jackson, in
the form of a catechism, gives a number of particulars
concerning the salt springs of Nantwich and the ways
of salt-making as practised in that town. It appears
from this account that each of the salt houses was still
furnished with six leads, but one learns that this number
of leads had, in the case of the majority of the salt-houses,
been converted into four iron-pans, rather more
than 3 ft. square by about 6 in. deep, and containing
the same quantity of brine as was previously distributed
among the six leads; while still more recently the four
pans had been again changed into two larger pans,
and some salt-makers had re-fashioned these two
receptacles into one great pan. The description which
Dr. Jackson gives of the process is so concise and
lucid that it may be reproduced here without the
alteration of a word. The question that he propounds
to himself <span class="locked">is—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span></p>

<p>“What is the manner of their (the salt-makers)
work? or what time of boiling the salt water? Whether
they use any peculiar thing to make it granulate,
and, if so, what that is?”</p>

<p>In the course of his reply, he says: “They use for
their fuel pitcoals brought out of Staffordshire. These
pans are set upon iron bars, bricked in very close.
They first fill their pans with brine out of the pit: which
comes to them in several wooden gutters: then they put
into their pans amongst the brine, a certain mixture,
made of about 20 gallons of brine, and two quarts of
calves’, cows’, and, chiefly, sheep’s blood. Of this
mixture they put about 2 quarts into a pan that holds
about 360 quarts of brine: this bloody brine at the first
boiling of the pan brings up a scum which they are
careful to skim off: they continue their fire as quick as
they can till half the brine be wasted, and this they call
boiling upon the fresh. But when it is half boiled away,
they fill their pans again with new brine out of the
ship (so they call a great cistern by their pan sides, into
which their brine runs through the wooden gutters from
the pump, that stands in the pit) then they put into the
pan two quarts of the mixture following: they take a
quart of white of eggs, beat them with as much brine,
as before was done with the blood; and thus that which
they call the whites is made. As soon as this is in, they
boil sharply till the second scum arise: then scum it off
as before, and boil very gently till it corne; to procure
which, when part of the brine is wasted they put into
each pan of the size aforesaid, about a quarter of a pint
of the best and strongest ale they can get: this makes a
momentary ebullition, which is soon over, and then
they abate their fires yet not so but that they keep it
boiling all over though gently: for the workmen say
that if they boil fast here, it wastes their salt. After<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
all their leach brine is in, they boil gently till a kind of
scum comes on it like a thin ice: which is the first appearance
of the salt: then that sinks and the brine everywhere
gathers into cornes at the bottom to it, which
they gently rake together with their loots, this they
continue till there is but very little brine left in the
pan: then with their loots they take it up, the brine
dropping from it, and throw it into their barrows,
which are cases made with flat cleft wickers, in the shape
almost of a sugar loaf, the bottom uppermost. When
the barrow is full they let it stand so for an hour and a
half in the trough where it drains out all the leach brine,
then they remove it into their hothouse behind their
works made there by two tunnels under their pans,
carried back for that purpose. The leach brine that
runs from the barrows they put into the next boiling,
for it is to their advantage being salt melted and
wanting only hardening.</p>

<p>“This work is performed in two hours in the smaller
pans, which are shallower, and generally boil their
brine more away: wherefore their salt will last better,
though it does not granulate so well, because when the
brine is wasted, the fire and stirring breaks the cornes.
But this salt weighs heavier and melts not so soon: and
therefore is bought for many sales to a distance. But
in the greater pans, which are usually deeper, they are
above half an hour longer in boiling; but because they
take their salt out of their brine, and only harden it
in their hothouse, it is apter to melt away in a moist
air: yet of this sort of salt the longer the grain is, the
longer it endures: and generally this is the better granulated
and the clearer, though the other be the whiter.
And I think it is rather the taking of the salt out of the
brine before it is wasted, that causes the granulating
of it, than the ale, to which the workmen impute it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span></p>

<p>“They never cover their pans at all, during the whole
time of boiling. They have their houses like barns open
up to the thatch with a cover-hole or two to vent the
steam of the pans.”</p>

  <div class="caption">THE GREAT CANAL-BURST AND LANDSLIP, OWING TO SUBSIDENCE NEAR NORTHWICH,
21ST JULY, 1907</div></div>

<p>On the subject of the supply and quality of the brine
obtained at Nantwich and Middlewich, Dr. Jackson
explains that the springs are rich or poor in a double
sense, as a spring may be rich in salt but poor in the
quantity of brine it affords. Thus, the chief pit at
Middlewich contained a rich brine yielding a full fourth
part of salt, but the supply was so meagre that the
inhabitants were “limited to their proportions out of
it,” and their requirements were made up out of pits
furnishing a weaker brine. The pit at Nantwich was
so plentiful as to supply all the salters, but while the
brine contained only a sixth part of salt, “such quick
use of it extremely strengthens the brine, perhaps to a
degree little less than that of Middlewich pit.” In
support of this statement that freshly drawn brine is
richer than the liquor that has stood for some days in
the pit, Dr. Jackson testified, as the result of personal
experiment, that “a quart of brine, when the pit has
been drawn off three or four days first, to supply five
or six wich-houses, has yielded an ounce and a half
more of salt than at another time, when it has had a
rest of a week or thereabouts.”</p>

<p>In the Droitwich locality of Worcestershire, the
quality of the brine closely resembled that of the
Cheshire salt springs. In the account by Dr. Thomas
Rastel, published in 1678 in the <cite>Philosophical Transactions</cite>,
the writer says: “In the great pit at Upwich,
we have at once three sorts of brine, which we call by
the names of first-man, middle-man, and last-man,
these sorts being of different strengths. The brine is
drawn by a pump: that which is in the bottom is first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
pumped out; which is that we call first-man, etc. A
quart measure of this brine weighs 29 ounces troy,
but of distilled water only 24 ounces. This brine yields
about a fourth part of salt; so that four tons of brine
make about a ton of salt. The other two sorts less,
or 28 ounces. And the pit yields 450 bushels of salt
per day. In the best pit at Netherwich a quart of
brine weighs 28 ounces and a half; this pit is 18 feet
deep and 4 broad, and yields as much brine every
24 hours as makes about 40 bushels of salt. The worst
pit at Netherwich is of the same breadth and depth as
the former: a quart of brine out of which weighs 27
ounces and yields as much brine daily as makes about
30 bushels of salt.”</p>

<p>Although Dr. Rastel’s account of the salt-making
methods in use at Droitwich coincides with that
employed about the same period in Cheshire, he explains
one or two minor variants and the reason of their
adoption. “The vats we boil the brine in,” he writes,
“are made of lead, cast into a flat plate 5 feet and a
half long and 3 feet over: having the side and ends beaten
up, and a little raised in the middle, which are set upon
brickwork called ovens, in which is a grate to make the
fire on, and an ash-hole which we call a trunk. In some
seals are 6 of these pans, in some 5, some 4, some 3,
some 2. In each of these pans is boiled at a time as
much brine as makes 3 pecks of white salt. For
clarifying the salt we should have little need, were it
not for dust accidentally falling into the brine. The
brine of itself being so clear that nothing can be clearer.
For clarifying it, we use nothing but the whites of eggs,
of which we take a quarter of a white, and put it into
a gallon or two of brine, which being beaten with the
hand, lathers as if it were soap, a small quantity of
which froth put into each vat raises all the scum, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
white of one egg clarifying 20 bushels of salt, by which
means our salt is as white as anything can be: neither
has it any ill savour, as that salt has that is clarified
with blood. For granulating it we use nothing at all,
for the brine is so strong of itself, that unless it be
often stirred, it will make salt as large grained as
bay-salt. I have boiled brine to a candy height, and
it has produced clods of salt as clear as the clearest
alum, like Isle of May salt: so that we are necessitated
to put a small quantity of rosin into the brine, to
make the grain of the salt small.”</p>

<p>“If it is asked why we use not iron pans as in
Cheshire,” Dr. Rastel concludes, “I answer there have
been trials made of both forged iron pans and cast iron.
The former the strength of the brine so corrodes, that
it quickly wears them out, the latter the brine breaks.”</p>

<p>The first serious attempt to effect a real improvement
in the making of salt from brine was communicated to
the Lords of the Admiralty in 1746 by Thomas Lowndes,
and under the title of “<span class="smcap">Brine Salt Improved</span> or the
Method of Making Salt from Brine, that shall be as
good or better than <span class="smcap">French Bay-Salt</span>.” It was published
in the same year in a handsomely printed, block-type
brochure of 40 pages by S. Austin, of Newgate Street,
Lowndes, who had spent his infancy in Middlewich
and had acquired in his youth a thorough acquaintance
with the Cheshire manner of salt-making, employed
several years in travelling in France, during which he
studied the process employed in the making of salt
by solar evaporation from sea-water in the neighbourhood
of Rochelle. At this time the bay-salt of Rochelle
was regarded by merchants, victuallers, and fishermen
as the best in Europe. He afterwards visited Holland
for the purpose of ascertaining why the Dutch white
herrings were superior to those cured in England, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
he learned that the cause was explained by the method
employed by the Dutch in purifying their salt. Armed
with the knowledge he had acquired in France and
Holland, and allowing for the difference between the
French, Dutch, and English brines, Lowndes offered
to enter into an agreement with the Admiralty to
supply them with a better article than the French
bay-salt, made by the following <span class="locked">process—</span></p>

<p>“<i>Let a</i> Cheshire <em>salt-pan</em>  (which commonly contains
about eight hundred gallons) <em>be filled with Brine, to
within about an inch of the top; then make and light the
fire; and when the Brine is just lukewarm, put in about
an ounce of blood from the butcher’s, or the whites of two
eggs; let the pan boil with all possible violence; as the
scum rises take it off; when the fresh or watery part is
pretty well decreased, throw into the pan the third part
of a pint of new ale, or that quantity of bottoms of malt-drink;
upon the Brine’s beginning to grain, throw into
it the quantity of a small nutmeg of fresh butter; and
when the liquor has sailed for about half an hour, that is,
has produced a good deal of Salt, draw the pan, in other
words, take out the Salt.</em>  By this time the fire will be
greatly abated, and so will the heat of the liquor.
<em>Let no more fewel be thrown on the fire; but let the Brine
gently cool, till one can just bear to put one’s hand into it;
keep the Brine of that heat as near as possible; and when
it has worked for some time, and is beginning to grain,
throw in the quantity of a small nutmeg of fresh butter;
and about two minutes after that, scatter throughout the
pan, as equally as may be, an ounce and three quarters of
clean common Allom pulverized very fine; and then
instantly, with the common iron-scrape-pan stir the Brine
very briskly in every part of the pan, for about a minute;
then let the pan settle, and constantly feed the fire, so that
the Brine may never be quite scalding hot, nor near so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
cold as lukewarm; let the pan stand working thus, for
about three days and nights, and then draw it.</em> </p>

<p>“The Brine remaining will by this time be so cold,
that it will not work at all; <em>therefore fresh Coals must
be thrown upon the fire, and the Brine must boil for about
half an hour, but not near so violently as before the first
drawing; then, with the usual instrument, take out such
Salt as is beginning to fall, (as they term it) and put it
apart; now let the pan settle and cool. When the Brine
becomes no hotter, than one can just bear to put ones
hand into it, proceed in all respects as before; only let
the quantity of Allom not exceed an ounce and a quarter.
And in about eight and forty hours after draw the
pan.</em> ”</p>

<p>This process, as will be seen, involved the use of
much slower fires than were usually employed in
Cheshire, and allowed the liquor to simmer instead of
boiling for a longer period. For this purpose, Mr.
Lowndes proposed to use a large proportion of cinders
in his furnaces, “since long boiling with great fires
not only deprives salt of its spirit and strength, but
causes its grain to become loose and soft, since cinders
are better than coals in preserving a constant, equal,
and gentle heat.” In order to correct the ill-effects
suffered by the salt through being made in an enclosed,
intensely hot room, filled with steam and smoke, he
had recourse to the use of alum, which, he claimed,
would restore to the salt its “natural cubical shoot and
give it a proper hardness.” He further claimed that
by this process the hot-houses or drying-houses could
be dispensed with, waste in carriage would be avoided,
and the pans would last three times as long; while, in
order to anticipate the inevitable objections of the salt-makers
and dispel the pretended difficulties that the
workmen would find in executing his directions, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
inventor explained that he had been careful to
accommodate his process, as near as possible, “to the
present practice in Cheshire.”</p>

<p>At the request of the Admiralty, the College of
Physicians conducted several examinations of salt made
by the Lowndes process, and reported that it was
“in all respects, a strong and pure salt, equal at least,
if not preferable to any we are acquainted with.”
On the strength of this testimonial, Mr. Lowndes applied
to the Admiralty to allow him a six months’ trial to
prove the goodness of his salt for domestic purposes,
twelve months to prove its excellence for the purpose
of the Fishery of America, and two years in which to
prove its efficacy in preserving beef and pork for the
Royal Navy. If in this series of tests it should be proved
that salt made by his process equalled French bay-salt,
he proposed that they should pay him a total sum of
£7,000, and should the trials demonstrate the slightest
inferiority, he would be content to make his country
a present of his labours. When the Admiralty declined
to enter into negotiations with him, Mr. Lowndes laid his
scheme before the House of Commons, which petitioned
the King to instruct the Admiralty to make the tests
on the inventor’s terms, but the sudden death of
Lowndes in 1748 closed the controversy.</p>

<p>But the determination to bring the art of salt-making
to “greater perfection” was not abandoned, although,
as Dr. William Brownrigg admitted, the success achieved
by Thomas Lowndes was thought by some people “to
supersede the necessity of any further attempts for
improving or extending our salt manufacture.” Brownrigg
commended Lowndes’s method and testified to the
purity and strength of his salt which had been exhibited
before the College of Physicians, but he maintained
that by other methods a purer and stronger salt might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
be made at a less expense. In point of fact, Dr.
Brownrigg’s objection to the Lowndes’ method was
that it was applied only to salt made from brine, or a
solution of English rock-salt often prepared with
impure water, and that the salt so produced, in his
opinion, was inferior to marine salt. Brownrigg, only
half realizing Lowndes’s intention, would appear to have
grasped the fact that his process aimed at economy of
fuel combined with uniformity in the degree and distribution
of heat, but he does not seem to have appreciated
the value of the improvement anticipated therefrom.</p>

<p>It must by this time have become evident to scientific
investigators and practical salt-men that the solution of
the problems of economical manufacture and increased
output lay in the application and regulation of heat.
Christopher Chrysel, of Leipsic, after fourteen years of
“great industry, much pains, and cost” spent in the
practice and study of salt-making in Cheshire, published
the result of his labours in 1787. Chrysel claimed that
by his method “with the least Fire and Coal the most
Salt can be made and the greatest Profit received such
as in no other way can possibly happen,” but curiously
enough the improvement for which he obtained a
Royal Patent, was primarily based upon a more
advantageous arrangement of the brine pans, while
the improvement effected in the furnace was treated as
a matter of only subsidiary importance. Chrysel
demonstrated his method at Bye Flat, near Northwich,
in Cheshire, in June, 1776. The experiment was carried
out in the presence of witnesses, the same pan was used
in testing both the old and the new methods, the same
two salt-boilers were employed in conducting both
operations, and the amounts of fuel consumed and salt
produced were carefully weighed and attested. The
results were recorded in the following report furnished by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
the Liverpool Agent of Mr. Richard Kent’s salt-works
at Bye <span class="locked">Flat—</span></p>

  <div class="caption">A SALT STORE-SHED</div></div>

<p>“In three ‘firings’ of 2 Furnaces under a salt pan
set up on the old plan ten years ago and constantly
worked till the present time—24 feet long: 15 feet
broad and 12 inches deep—filled with Brine three
times in a half week, and boiled down each time in
24 hours and the salt drawn out there was burnt 5½ tons
of Coal and made 7 tons 31 bushels, or 155½ cwts.
of salt.</p>

<p>“After the experiment the Patentee, Mr. Christopher
Chrysel, set up the same pan on his improved Patent
Method, and then in three similar firings in half a week
as before there was only burnt 3 tons 5 cwt. of coal and
made 8 tons 2 cwts. or 162 cwts. of salt=2 tons 10 cwts.
of salt per ton of fuel.”</p>

<p>Chrysel says in his treatise that the pan mentioned
in his experiments—24 ft. long, 15 ft. broad, and 12 in.
deep—will be regarded by his German readers as of
phenomenal bigness, but he explains that in England
it is looked upon as only a medium-sized receptacle.
The pans in use in Cheshire at this period were of
various sizes, but the tendency was to introduce pans
of increasing dimensions. “Indeed I can with all truth
say,” he writes, “that in England I have seen with
my own eyes, pans two, three and four times as big
(as the one he used at Bye Flat) and have measured
them with my own hands, and have proved each one
designedly and have seen and marked and become
persuaded that from large salt pans the greater advantage
and the most noted cheapness in the manufacture
of salt depend and proceed.”</p>

<p>In the course of his experiments with pans of all
sizes, he proved that in a small pan, 8 ft. square and
9 in. deep, heated with one furnace, he obtained in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
five weeks a clear profit of £35 15s. 2d., while in one
pan, compounded out of five of the small pans, and
heated with two furnaces, the profit of one week’s
working was £42 15s. 5d., or a net additional profit of
£7 0s. 3d., and the saving of four weeks in time and
labour.</p>

<p>He further experimented with three of the largest
pans for one week, with the following <span class="locked">results—</span></p>

<p>“The first—36 by 25 feet and 13 inches deep holding
975 cubic feet of Brine—burnt in 3 Furnaces in one
week 12 tons of coal and made 32 tons 2 cwts. of
salt.</p>

<p>“The second—40 by 27 ft. and 13 inches deep
holding 1170 cubic feet of brine—burnt in 3 Furnaces
in a week 15 tons 18 cwts. of coal and made 34½ tons
of salt.</p>

<p>“The third—52 by 26 feet and 13 inches deep holding
1464 cubic feet of Brine—burnt in 4 Furnaces in one
week, 24 tons of coal and made 62 tons of salt.”</p>

<p>Chrysel is himself amazed that pans containing 360,
900, and even 1,400 cubic feet of brine can be boiled
into salt in the same space of time, and he is feign to
admit that “up to now, nobody, to my knowledge,
has proved what length, breadth, and depth of pan is
calculated to make the most salt with the least consumption
of coal. Consequently everywhere are to be
found many different pans, and other varieties are
continually being tested. And I myself cannot feel
that I am capable of deciding the question, nevertheless
I will, from my experience and conscientious conviction,
say what I consider is the best, cheapest, and most
reliable pan for this purpose.”</p>

<p>After long search, and close inquiry in numerous
salt-works, and as the result of his study of salt-making
in pans of every size, Chrysel came to the conclusion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
that a single pan—“26 feet long, 18 feet broad, and
12 inches deep, with two furnaces, in a roomy salt-works
with sufficient room for the workmen and baskets
on both sides of the pan”—was to be preferred to all
others. But this considered judgment was amended after
further application to the problem by advocating an
increase in length without changing the breadth of the
pan. His ultimate verdict was in favour of a pan
52 ft. long, 18 ft. broad, and 1 ft. deep, with a capacity
of 936 cubic feet of brine, equipped with two furnaces,
and he declared that this pan, producing about 638 cwt.
of salt per week, at a cost of £10 5s. 6d. for fuel, and
selling for £127 15s. 6d., and giving a profit of £117 10s.
was “the perfect article.”</p>

<p>Although, as I have pointed out, Chrysel’s patent
was principally concerned with the arrangement of the
brine pans, which were so arranged as to obtain the
maximum amount of heat from the fuel consumed in
the furnaces, in the course of his experiments he
evolved an improved, if by no means a perfect, furnace.
The peculiar nature of the superiority effected was
based on the common knowledge that it is the natural
tendency of fire heat and smoke to escape into the open
air and disappear. He proceeds: “If, however, they are
confined and shut up in a furnace under a salt pan they
still require an opening to escape to the chimney else
the fire cannot burn and is extinguished. If however
the opening and place of exit into the draughts and
chimney is too large and wide, as it is generally, and
particularly under salt pans, not only will the draught
of Air cause Wood and Coal to be more rapidly consumed
and changed into Ashes which will choke the
fire but also the fireheat and smoke will, by the draught
of the air, hasten into the draughts and chimney, and
the bottom of the pan will hardly be touched and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
scarcely half the work be done. On the contrary, if the
opening and exit into the draughts and chimney has a
proper proportion, according to the different sizes of
the Pans and to the requisite Fire in the Furnace under
the pan, the Fireheat and Smoke will be longer contained
under the pan and that, steadily coming from the
Furnace, will be increased and strengthened, so that
double work under the pan will result, and wood or
coal will not so rapidly be burnt to ashes but last
longer and consequently do more work. All that is
required in this is to calculate the mathematical proportion
between the different sizes of the pans, the
Furnace and the Fires and between the opening and
Exit into the draughts and chimney, and to apply it.”</p>

<p>It will be recognized that both Lowndes and Chrysel
were on the way to the solution of the problem of the
perfect salt-making plant when they devoted themselves
to the improvement of the furnace, but another
century and a half was to elapse before the secret that
eluded their efforts should be revealed. The luckless
Furnival, some fifty years later than Chrysel, approached
nearly to the goal to which they were all striving, and
he, in common with his forerunners, had his share of
the savage jealousy and persecution that the salt-men
have ever visited upon those who venture into the
lists with them. “No malice has been wanting to
bring a disreputation upon my salt; and every wicked
art will be practised to render its virtues ineffectual.
The Salt Commissioners are my avowed enemies; for
the miscarrying of my attempts will be their gain.”
Thus wrote poor Lowndes, and Chrysel had similar
grounds for complaint. “Before the above proof (the
result of his experiment at Bye Fleet) was made openly,
nobody believed in the anticipated saving,” he says,
“but everybody doubted and some declared it to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
impossible. After, however, the thing was made known,
everybody on the contrary was in a state of wonderment.
In a short time wonder was changed into envy, ill-will
and malice, and many attempts were made to suppress
me and destroy my patent, although it was not possible
for any one to point out any failures or errors.” We
shall see presently how the salt-men dealt with their
successor, William Furnival.</p>

<p>Henry Holland, writing in 1808 on “The Production
of Salt Brine,” furnishes some reliable details concerning
the manufacture of brine-salt as it was conducted in
Cheshire at the beginning of the nineteenth century.
According to this authority: “The pans used in Cheshire,
for the evaporating of the brine, are now made of
wrought iron. The dimensions of these vary very much;
but, in general, those of modern erection are considerably
larger than what were in use a few years ago;
and they usually contain from 600 to 800 superficial
feet. One or two pans of still larger dimensions have
been erected, each containing nearly 1,000 feet. Their
usual form is that of an oblong square, and their depth
from 12 to 16 inches. To a pan containing 600 to 800
superficial feet, there are usually three furnaces, from
six and a half to seven feet long, and 20 to 24 inches
wide. The grates are from two and a half to three feet
from the bottom of the pan. The furnace-doors are
single, and there are no doors to the ash-pits.</p>

<p>“The different pans are usually partitioned out from
each other, and there is a separate pan-house to each
pan. Within this pan-house, at one end is the coal-hole;
the chimney occupies the other end, there is a walk
along the two remaining sides of the pan, five or six
feet wide; and between these walks and the sides of the
pan-house, which are generally of wood, long benches
four or five feet wide, are fixed, on which the salt is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
placed in conical baskets to drain after it has been
taken out of the pan; a wooden or slated roof is placed
over the pan-house, with louvres to allow the steam
to pass freely out.</p>

<p>“The manufacture is conducted in several different
ways, or rather heat is applied in various degrees, to
effect the evaporation of the water of solution; and
according to these different degrees of heat, the product
is the stoved or lump salt; common salt; the large
grained flaky; and large grained or fishery salt.”</p>

<p>In the making of stoved salt, the brine was brought
to a boiling heat—which in brine fully saturated is
226 degrees of Fahrenheit—and the pan was twice filled
in the course of twenty-four hours. In the making of
common salt, the brine was first brought to boiling
heat, for the double purpose of expediting saturation
and clearing the brine of any earthy contents, and
then, moderating the fires, the process of crystallization
was completed with the brine heated to 160 or 170
degrees of Fahrenheit. The pan in which common salt
was made was filled only once in twenty-four hours.
The large grained, flaky salt was made with an evaporation
conducted at the heat of 130 or 140 degrees, and
the pan was filled once in every forty-eight hours; while
in the case of fishery salt, the brine was brought to a
heat of from 100 to 110 degrees of Fahrenheit, and five
or six days were required to evaporate the water of
solution. In the course of these several processes,
various additions were often made to the brine, with
the view of promoting the separation of any earthy
mixture, or the more ready crystallization of the salt.
These additions varied in different works, and many
of them seem to have been made from ill-founded
prejudices without any exact idea as to their probable
effects. The principal additions made at various times<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
were acids, animal jelly and gluten, vegetable mucilage,
new or stale ale, wheat-flour, resin, butter, and alum.</p>

<p>Holland believed that the addition of acids to the brine
was an innovation based upon the mistaken idea that
the use of acid accounted for the superiority of the
Dutch salt, but at the time at which he wrote the practice
had been discontinued in Cheshire. Animal jelly
and gluten for clearing the brine and promoting the
separation of the earthy contents, were much used in
preference to blood, which, while excellent for the
purpose when fresh, was difficult to procure in sufficient
quantity and to preserve from putrefaction. White of
eggs, glue, and jelly procured by boiling cows’ and
calves’ feet, were also found to answer perfectly well
for the purpose of clarifying brine, but the use of new
or stale ale and beer grounds as a brine clarifier, had
been abandoned as inefficacious by Cheshire salt-men.
Dr. Brownrigg was of opinion that salt-boilers had
little to plead in favour of the addition of butter during
the evaporation process, beyond immemorial custom,
but Holland considered the salt-makers had ample
grounds for their belief that butter assisted the granulation
of the salt and made the brine “work more
kindly.” On the question of the addition of alum
opinions varied. Lowndes ascribed the superiority of
his salt to the use of alum, but Brownrigg declared
that “the goodness of Mr. Lowndes’ salt does not
seem to be owing to the alum with which it is mixed,
but may be attributed chiefly to the gentle heat used
in the preparation.”</p>

  <div class="caption">WITTON BROOK, NORTHWICH. SUBMERGED TRACT OF AGRICULTURAL LAND</div></div>

<p>Holland combated the general impression obtaining
at the time, that salt formed from the same brine
varied by the application of different degrees of heat,
not only in external appearance but also in quality,
and the equally prevalent idea that salt formed from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
natural brine was inferior in its power of preserving
animal flesh to bay-salt. He proved by quotation
and experiment that such prejudices were entirely
unfounded, and proceeded to show that the action of
bay-salt is exactly similar to that of the large-grained
salt, and that neither variety has any advantage over
the salt prepared by a boiling heat except in the size
and compactness of its crystals and in its containing a
somewhat smaller proportion of the water of crystallization;
and as the large-grained fishery salt is more
than equal to the bay salt in these important points, it
at least equals the latter in its power of preserving
animal flesh or provisions.</p>

<p>The first person who introduced steam heat into the
manufacture of salt, and, in so doing, anticipated the
revolutionary improvements which were achieved some
three-quarters of a century later by the Vacuum System
and the Hodgkinson Patent Salt-Making Process, was
William Furnival. For our knowledge of the intentions
and achievements of this bold and persevering innovator
we have to rely almost entirely upon his “Statement
of Facts, Humbley and Respectfully submitted to the
Consideration of His Majesty, His Majesty’s Ministers,
and Both Houses of Parliament.” In this document
we have a story of oppression, conspiracy, and persecution
which the author describes as “unparalleled in
free England,” and since his narration of the treatment
he endured has never been refuted, we must conclude
that the gist of what he writes is substantially true.
It is to be regretted that in this only available account
of his activities, Furnival is so intent upon exposing
the wrongs to which he had been subjected that he
omits to furnish us with a detailed description of his
process. We know that in 1823 Furnival erected works
at Droitwich and commenced making salt, and we have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
his assurance that his patent answered every expectation
he had formed of it. Moreover, its working was
investigated by Messrs. S. Fowler, Fardon &amp; Co., who,
on 17th April, 1824, certified that the advantages of
the Furnival method over all existing processes,
<span class="locked">consisted—</span></p>

<p>“Firstly.—In the saving of fuel which may be
stated at about one-half.</p>

<p>“Secondly.—In the production of twice the quantity
of salt, as usually made in vessels of the same size, in
a given space of time.</p>

<p>“Thirdly.—In the superior quality of the salt,
arising out of the regular distribution of heat to the
bottom of the brine pan.”</p>

<p>In April, 1825, Furnival disposed of his salt property
at Anderton, and three years later, to a month, he
bought property at Marston for £1,550. On this ground
he erected works covering an area of about twelve
acres, and installed some three miles of pannage at a
cost of upwards of £135,000, capable of producing
some 130,000 tons of salt per annum. He subsequently
bought and started to erect works intended, when
finished, to occupy nearly six acres of ground at Marston.
He asserted that these Wharton and Marston properties
were the only two in the kingdom possessing the peculiar
advantages of inexhaustible supplies of fully saturated
brine and dry rock-salt on the same premises, and he
claimed that he could not only deliver rock-salt at fully
25 to 30 per cent. less than any other mine in the
country, but, further, that the salt made on his principle
was admitted to be superior in quality, owing to the
regular distribution of heat, by which more uniform
and superior crystals were produced. In the autumn
of 1829, he opened negotiations in two separate quarters
to lease on royalty certain portions of his salt-works<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
at Wharton, and two committees, each consisting of
three men, were appointed by the prospective tenants
to investigate the system. On 22nd August, 1829, the
two committees drew up a joint report, from which I
extract the <span class="locked">following—</span></p>

<p>“The first committee entered upon the investigation
on the 15th August, 1829; remained on duty eight hours;
was then relieved by the second for the like period,
and so continued the investigation, alternately superintending
the weighing and delivery of the coals and
salt, and taking note of the temperatures every hour.</p>

<p>“The following is the result of working for 162 hours,
a steam boiler, constantly fed with brine, the specific
gravity from 23 to 25·100ths.</p>

<p>“Being a product of four and a half tons of salt for
every ton of coals consumed.”</p>

<p>It will be convenient here to explain what became
of these several Furnival properties, and then describe
very briefly the stages which led to the inventor’s incarceration
in Horsemonger Lane Gaol and caused him to
address his Statement of Facts to the Government.
In April, 1825, he sold his works at Anderton to the
British Rock and Salt Company, which continued to
ship salt until 1829. The Marston property appears to
have been worked until 1847. The Wharton works
were managed by Trustees until 1839, when they were
taken over by the National Patent Salt Company,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
which became one of the most important firms in the
Winsford trade. In 1875, Justice Manisty, the surviving
leaseholder, transferred his interests to Stubbs
Brothers, who, in 1888, disposed of the business to the
Salt Union.</p>

<p>Furnival had no sooner established himself as a
salt-maker at Anderton than the old salt proprietors,
“who had contrived in the past to ruin all, or any one
who should dare to enter the lists against them,” became
seriously alarmed at the apparent magnitude of his
plans and the great improvements which threatened
both their exorbitant profits and their hitherto unchallenged
monopoly. Furnival, to employ a colloquialism,
proceeded to “back himself both ways.” Having more
than once proved his strength by breaking up “the
Coalition” (which the old proprietors had formed to
regulate the output and price of salt), and bringing
down the price of common salt from 20s. to 8s. per ton,
he offered to erect his patent apparatus at his own cost
and risk on the works of his wealthy rivals, and to
allow them two-thirds of the saving effected by its
application. According to Furnival’s unsupported but
uncontradicted account, they ridiculed his offer, declaring
that they wanted none of his patents, that they
could command their own profits in defiance of him,
and that they would never sanction any improvements
or innovations in the trade.</p>

<p>Furnival, who had secured patents for France and
the Netherlands, thereafter gave his English competitors
a rest and proceeded to erect salt-works at
Rotterdam and Ghent capable of taking nearly 60,000
tons of rock salt annually from the British market.
But the English salt refiners prompted their Dutch and
Belgian <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">confrères</i> to bring official discredit upon the
enterprise, and Furnival and his partner were compelled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
to abandon their works, which had cost them £13,000
to erect, and to forgo the £33,000 they were to have
received for their patent rights.</p>

<p>Furnival returned to England and set up his salt-works
at Wharton, where he “produced some of the
finest rock-salt in the kingdom.” The old proprietors
decided that no sacrifice was too great that would
have the effect of crushing this competitor. They
lowered the price of rock-salt 50 per cent., and kept
manufactured salt so low that every establishment was
worked at a loss. A meeting of proprietors, convened
to consider the situation, resolved that while “they
deeply lamented the low price of salt, they considered,
at the same time, that it would not be prudent to
raise the price until Mr. Furnival was disposed of.”
The salt manufacturers admitted, in a circular published
in 1829, that this cutting-out operation had, in four and
a half years, involved the trade in a loss of £282,194 14s.,
but it had the effect of frightening away Furnival’s
financial supporters, and landed him in further
misfortunes.</p>

  <div class="caption">WORKING IN DANGEROUS GROUND AFTER SUBSIDENCE,

<p>In 1826, Furnival had entered into a contract with
a Peter Bouvain to erect a salt-works in the Isle of
Rhé, but the month that was required to prove the
capabilities of the patent plant was sufficient to demonstrate
the commercial worthlessness of the Frenchman,
and Furnival cut his loss and returned to England.
Bouvain brought a claim against him for the loss of
prospective profits and obtained a judgment for £8,000,
against which Furnival appealed to the Court of Cassation
in Paris. Before the case was heard, Furnival
was inveigled to the Netherlands by a forged invitation,
purporting to come from a wealthy Belgian salt-refiner,
driven over the frontier, arrested in France at the
suit of Bouvain, and thrown into gaol. Finding that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
legal redress was unobtainable, Furnival escaped from
prison after four months’ incarceration, and in January,
1830, was again in Cheshire. He was engaged in a
bitter and protracted altercation with his two sets of
tenants in the Wharton salt-works in August, 1832,
when he was arrested for the non-payment of his debt
of £8,180 to Bouvain, and lodged in Horsemonger
Lane Gaol. In January, 1833, he brought an action
for perjury against Bouvain, who fled to France to
escape the warrant that was issued for his arrest, but
this moral victory brought Furnival neither release nor
amelioration of his lot, and he found himself “foully
and unjustly charged by a band of conspirators, defeated
in every attempt to obtain justice, and left without a
hope or prospect of being able to vindicate himself,
or extricate himself from a confinement more close
than that awarded to a felon.” The end of Furnival
need not occupy us; he came into the salt trade in 1822
with a sufficiency of financial backing, an unusual stock
of confidence and energy, and a patent which “created
a sensation through the whole salt trade”; we take
our leave of him eleven years later in a debtors’ gaol—a
victim to the methods which the Cheshire salt proprietors
invariably adopted in ridding themselves of an
obtrusive competitor.</p>

<span class="subhead">FORMATION AND EXTENT OF THE CHESHIRE
DEPOSITS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The</span> theories propounded and the conclusions arrived
at on the subject of the formation of the Cheshire
salt beds do not differ in any important particular
from those which have been put forward, investigated,
and accepted with regard to rock-salt deposits in all
parts of the world, but, because of the enormous
geologic and climatic changes that have occurred in
the English county since a salt basin was in course of
formation there, scientists were slower in accepting those
conclusions in respect of our home deposits than in
the case of the salt areas which are found in the Runn
of Kutch, at Lake Elton, or Black Gulph on the eastern
side of the Caspian Sea.</p>

<p>The facts that the chief accompaniment of every
known deposit of rock-salt is clay, and that clay is
deposited in water, formed the basis of the erroneous
theory that because salt is a deposit out of water, and
sea-water contains salt, all salt beds must have been
deposited in the sea. But salt does not mix mechanically
with water and has not been deposited like sedimentary
rocks; it forms a solution, and not until the
solution becomes super-saturated does it crystallize out.
Now sea-water rarely contains more than 3½ per cent.
of salt, and since the solution must contain at least
26 per cent. of salt before the salt will crystallize out,
and, provided it is left from contact with the air, a
solution of this strength may be left for an indefinite
length of time without a single particle of salt depositing,
the old theory that all salt beds were deposited in the
sea had to be abandoned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span></p>

<p>The theory of the sea-water deposition of salt beds
having been disposed of, it was long a popular idea
that the beds of rock-salt owed their formation to
volcanic action. Professor C. Thompson was of opinion
that some enormous electrical force had been at work
in its crystallization; Professor Silvestri found quantities
of chloride of sodium varying from 50 to 90 per cent.
in different sublimations in the lava which was erupted
from Etna in 1863; Bunsen discovered a considerable
but less important sublimation of chloride of sodium
in the lava erupted from Hekla in 1854; and G.&#160;F.
Rodwell and H.&#160;M. Elder also recognized small traces
of sodic chloride as one of the products of volcanic
action. In a paper contributed to the Manchester
Geological Society, in 1842, on “An Inquiry into the
Origin of the Salt Field of Cheshire,” so respected an
authority as Ormerod stated his conclusions as <span class="locked">follows—</span></p>

<p>“(<i>a</i>) That from the lithological character of the
accompanying beds and partings, and from the regularity
in the thickness of the respective beds, as far as the
same were now known, these salt beds were, in his
opinion, deposited from an aqueous menstruum, and
had not been injected.</p>

<p>“(<i>b</i>) That from the absence of marine remains, from
the salt deposits containing matter not found in the
ocean, and from similar beds of salt not being in any
place known to have been formed from the ocean, he
considered that there were not satisfactory reasons for
ascribing the origin of the salt found in the new red
sandstone of England to marine deposits.</p>

<p>“(<i>c</i>) That from the minerals found associated with
the salt, and adjoining red sandstone rocks, being
similar to those found together with it in volcanic
districts in other parts of the world; that from former
or present volcanic action being apparent at localities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
in various parts of the globe, at which beds of salt of
similar character are found, and the origin of which
can be evidently traced to that cause, and from the
salt beds in England being always found accompanied
by neighbouring traces of volcanic action, he considered
that there were satisfactory reasons for ascribing the
origin of the salt fields of England to volcanic agency.”</p>

<p>Ormerod was not only convinced that the Cheshire
deposits were the result of volcanic action which had
impregnated neighbouring lagoons and formed the
aqueous menstruum from which those beds were
precipitated, but that these lakes lay in depressions of
the upper New Red Sandstone, and that the alternation
of the strata of rock and salt had arisen from subsidences,
followed or accompanied by fresh discharges of the
same impregnating matter.</p>

<p>This theory is untenable, for beyond the fact that
salt has been ejected in volcanic eruptions there is
practically nothing to support it. Volcanic action is
always accompanied by intense heat, and the fact that
the pure rock crystal is one of slow growth in a cool
liquid, and is not of rapid formation in a hot fluid,
conclusively disposes of the volcanic theory. Particles
of chloride of sodium in volcanic ejections were no
explanation of the formation of huge deposits of rock-salt,
and since it was realized that salt in large quantity
can only be obtained from salt water, and that it cannot
be got naturally from the sea, it became evident that
what man does in isolating tracts of sea-water to produce
salt by solar evaporation, must have been practised by
nature on an extensive scale in all ages. And as an
isolated tract of salt water is a salt lake, we are directed
to the obvious conclusion that all rock-salt formations
have been deposited in salt lakes.</p>

<p>In support of this theory we have the evidence of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
the salt-forming process that is now in operation in
Southern Russia, America, and India. It is evident
that at one time the low-lying country to the west and
north of the Caspian Sea was part of that inland sea,
and that, when its surface was contracted by shrinkage,
the retreating water left behind it numerous swamps,
which now form salt lakes, and tracts of intervening
land which, in the dry season, are covered with a saline
afflorescence. The large quantities of salt which, in
ordinary seasons are deposited in these salt lakes, are
collected by the Russian Government. In India there
are many salt lakes, such as Lake Sambhur, in Rajpootana,
which in the rainy season has a length of from
fifteen to twenty miles, but in the dry season is only
three or four miles long, the remainder of its course
consisting of a succession of small salt pools alternating
with stretches of salt-encrusted ground. In the great
desert of Mongolia many square miles of country are
spread with salt incrustations; and in America similar
tracts are found which once formed the beds of considerable
lakes. In Nevada, at the sink of the Carson
River, is an area of five square miles which was once
the bed of a salt lake. The famous Great Salt Lake,
between the Wahsatch Mountains and the Nevadas in
America, is the remains of a large inland sea which once
covered the district, and should the climate become
drier than it is now, the shrinkage, which went on for
ages, will be resumed, and a huge salt deposit will be
formed.</p>

<p>The salt lakes in rainless districts soon dry up, and
the salt, being quickly deposited, is almost pure, but
such instances are not usual, and, in dealing with
existing salt-depositing lakes, we find continual references
to the salt and clay mixtures, or alternations of
the deposits. Herr Cech tells us that the yearly layers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
of salt in Lake Elton are separated from one another
by a layer of black mud; beneath the fourth layer is
found black clay, and beneath this are further layers
of salt of a more solid quality. Schleiden, in speaking
of Lake Elton, says: “On this old salt is deposited a
blackish mud layer (salt clay) which separates the salt
from the next succeeding layer. In 1805 Göbel bored,
in the very shallow lake, about 1½ miles from the shore.
He found forty-two distinctly separated layers of
rock salt, the uppermost from 1 to 4 inches thick, the
lowest 9 inches thick. The deeper he bored the more
solid the salt was, and the more pure. At the hundredth
layer the salt was so hard that the iron tool broke.”</p>

<p>From the foregoing, which are among a great collection
of accepted data, it will be seen that, in whatever
quarter of the world salt lakes occur, the same characteristics
are encountered, viz., salt depositing on mud
and covered by mud. Every shower of rain creates a
certain amount of mud or sand, and every brook and
stream running into the salt lakes during the rainy
season brings in a certain quantity of the same material.
The mud represents the wet season of the year, and
the salt the dry season. The geological conditions must
have been the same when salt was deposited in Cheshire,
and with the instances of modern salt-forming regions
before us, and the strata of the Cheshire salt country to
guide us, it must be concluded that the genesis of
rock-salt, modified by local circumstances, must have
been the same in every case. Indeed, in the face of
the evidence, it seems certain that the Cheshire beds of
rock-salt have been crystallized out of the saturated
waters of salt lakes, and that their admixture of marl
has been caused by streams running into the lakes
during the wet seasons, and that the peculiar amorphous
mixture of marl and salt known as rock-salt is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
result of the continual growth of pure salt crystals, and
their partial destruction by mud-bearing fresh waters.</p>

<p>This conclusion on the subject, which is now generally
accepted, is based on the theory that the Cheshire salt
lake was situated in a desert, or more probably a salty
<em>steppe</em> , such as are found in the region of the Caspian
Sea, and that the climate was divided into wet and dry
seasons. The presence of rock-salt supports these
ideas, because the marls could only be formed in periods
of heavy rainfall, and the salt could only crystallize
out in dry, water-evaporating periods. It is further
evident that the lake, though extensive in area, was
shallow, and that the dry seasons produced extensive
shrinkages and caused salt to form in the saturated
water that remained in the deeper parts, while the
occurrence of the deep deposits in a shallow lake is
explained by the constantly varying elevation and
depression of the earth’s surface. The difficulty of
explaining how the salt in this lake could be renewed
to enable the waters to go on depositing for a geologic
age is recognized, but it is no greater than that which
is presented by scores of existing salt lakes out of which
thousands of tons of salt are taken annually without
causing any apparent diminution in the salt which forms
year by year. And when it is considered that, in a lake
having a probable area of from 500 to 1,000 square
miles, the known salt deposits do not occupy 50 square
miles, and in many portions contain 50 per cent. of
marl, the difficulty does not seem to be insuperable.
It is, moreover, safe to conclude that, when the bar
rose that eventually cut off the Cheshire lake from the
sea, it would be many years before the high tides ceased
to wash over it and replenish the lake, and Dr. Ball’s
theory as to the enormity of the tides that occurred in
past ages—owing to the moon being nearer to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
earth than at present—reveals a means by which the
lake might continue to receive fresh accessions of
sea-water for many generations.</p>

<p>Irrespective of all theories, the outstanding fact
remains that enormous beds of salt were deposited in
the Cheshire salt lake, and an examination of the
strata in the appended Northwich section will enable
the salt to tell its own history.</p>

<p>The formation has only been bored through to a
depth of 525 ft., where we find an unpierced stratum,
18 ft. thick, of hard marl. Above it are 6 ft. of pure
rock-salt, then 81 ft., of marl with thick veins of rock-salt,
then 3 ft. of nearly pure salt, then 83 ft. of marl<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
with thin veins of salt, and above it 4 ft. of marl and
salt. So far it is evident that the wet seasons predominated,
and that marl was deposited far more
extensively than salt. For a time, a cycle of dry seasons
prevailed; a great change occurred, and a bed of rock-salt,
84 ft. in thickness, was deposited. In other parts,
the bed of rock-salt varies from 80 ft. to over 100 ft.
in thickness, none of which is perfectly pure, and not
more than 20 ft. of it is sufficiently pure to be of commercial
use. The greatly changed seasons are indicated
by these formations. A portion near the bottom, containing
less clay, shows a less copious or less protracted
rainfall, and these periods were followed by wet seasons
and the presence of much clay. After a time, so much
rain fell that for a period sufficiently long for about
30 ft. of marl to deposit, practically no salt formed.
Here and there in this deposit are veins of salt, and as
these are perpendicular and run as if deposited in rifts
or cracks of the marl, the salt doubtless belongs to the
next period, when another change occurred and another
bed of salt, varying from 50 to 80 ft. in thickness, was
deposited. The whole of this bed is fairly full of marl,
and, for an untold period, marls were deposited, covering
up the rock-salt.</p>

<p>The cycles of greater or less rainfalls are traceable in
the varying preponderance of marls, in the crystallization
of salt, and in the form in which the rock-salt is
found. Each minute cube starts as a crystal from some
independent point of rock salt, and these increase in
numbers until they form a mass of crystallization
possessing no distinct lines or features. Had the dry
season continued for a long period a thick mass of
rock-salt would have been formed. The floor of the
lake would have been covered with salt crystals, like
the crystal floor of a mine, and the moment the rainy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
season commenced, and the brooks began to bring in
fresh water and mud, these crystals, being attacked by
non-saturated water, immediately lost their sharp angles
and became covered with a fine layer of mud. As soon
as the crystals became completely covered they ceased
to dissolve, but the angles and cubes disappeared, and
a shapeless mass of mixed salt and mud was formed.
With the next dry season, crystallization again set in
and another crystal floor was produced, to be again
destroyed by the succeeding wet season. This constant
growth and destruction of crystals went on for ages,
until the salt beds were formed and the water ceased to
become super-saturated.</p>

<p>Scientific exploration work and a great number of
borings have enabled us to form a fairly accurate
estimate of the area of the Cheshire salt-beds, except
in the region to the north of the deposits, where systematic
examination has still to be undertaken. Without
quoting the exact locations of bore-holes and distances
between them—particulars which would convey little
or nothing to the general reader—it may be broadly
stated that the proved salt area in the Northwich
district is about four square miles, while the increasing
quantity of marl that is mixed with the salt to the
northward favours the probability that the beds soon
die out in that direction. The Winsford salt district
comprises an area of six square miles, while it is
calculated, with less preciseness, that the Middlewich,
Nantwich, and Lawton districts all contain large
quantities of rock-salt. At the bore-hole at Marston,
which appears to be on the highest proved portion of
the salt-bed, the salt is found at 47 ft. below ordnance
datum, and from this central point the surface of the
salt falls away gently in every direction. Mr. James
Thompson, a recognized local authority upon salt and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
salt-mining, writing on the subject nearly fifty years
ago, gave the thickness of the upper bed of rock-salt
at about twenty-five yards, but that thickness was
only maintained within a circle of about three miles
in circumference, beyond which he found that it thinned
off rapidly on the upper surface. The extent of the
second or bottom bed, from which all the rock-salt
produced in Cheshire since 1780 has been extracted, is
less clearly defined, but it is known to underlie not only
the whole of the upper bed, but a further considerable
area in all directions.</p>

<p>Professor Thompson, in calculating the period of
time that was required to lay the salt contents comprised
in these deposits, fixed upon an inch in ten years
as a fair estimate of the rate of progress at which it
was accumulated, and found that it must have taken
21,000 years to lay 60 yds. of rock-salt. With this
figure before us, it is interesting to study the following
calculation of the salt contents of the Cheshire deposits
and of the quantity of mineral that is extracted from
the interior of the earth in the form of brine to produce
the salt that is made in the Cheshire districts.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Taking the upper bed of rock-salt at an average

rock-salt.</p>

cubic yard of rock-salt weighs 32 cwts., therefore

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span></p>

<p>Taking the bottom bed as extending over the same
area, but having a thickness of 35 yds., we find in <span class="locked">it—</span></p>

<p class="center">
9,292,800 × 35 × 32 / 20 = 520,396,800 tons,

<p class="in0">or, in both beds together, 892,108,800 tons.</p>

<p>The Winsford district, taking the beds of rock-salt
at an average thickness of 65 yds., which is 5 yds. less
than the figure given by Dickinson, we have 1,932,902,400
tons.</p>

<p>As the whole of the white salt has been manufactured
from brine derived from the rock-salt, it represents so
many tons of rock-salt pumped up. Now, as the
specific gravity of rock-salt is 2·125, a cubic yard
contains 32 cwts. This being the case, we find the
cubic yards of rock-salt pumped up annually in each
district to be, <span class="locked">viz.—</span></p>

<p class="in0">Making a total of 853,750 cubic yds. This represents
176·5 acres of 1 yd. thick.</p>

<p>This is entirely independent of the rock-salt, which,
at a low estimate, equals 120,000 tons per annum, or,
say, 75,000 cubic yds., or 15·5 acres of 1 yd. thick.</p>

<p>In these calculations no allowance has been made
for wastage, and this is very large. During the year
every pan requires picking from six to twelve times,
the stoved oftener than the common. This necessitates
the pan being swept out and an enormous quantity of
brine wasted. Besides this, the pan scale contains a
large percentage of salt. Again, in <em>drawing</em>  the salt
out of the pans a large quantity of brine is wasted.
Add to this also the leakage in pipes, overflow of
cisterns, leakage through defective pans, etc., and the
total of wastage will be very large. It is scarcely
possible to estimate this, but if we calculate 10 per cent.
we shall be under the mark. Thus, for waste, we may
set down 136,600 tons. This would represent 85,075
cubic yds., or 17·65 acres 1 yd. thick.</p>

<p>We thus see that 209·65 acres of rock-salt 1 yd. thick
is every year consumed in the Cheshire salt district.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE CHESHIRE SUBSIDENCES</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The</span> salt industry of Cheshire may be divided into three
periods, viz.: the natural brine period, the rock-salt
period, and the prepared brine period. From Saxon
times up to the last quarter of the seventeenth century
the manufacture of white salt from brine had been
continued without interruption, but the output had
never been large. In 1675 the production of the
three “Wiches” was returned at 20,000 tons, and all
the evidence shows that the total annual make had
never exceeded 30,000 tons. In 1670, rock-salt was
discovered in the county, and for the next hundred
years, although brine continued to be worked, rock-salt
mining was the chief producing industry. With the
collapse of the mines, the salt proprietors turned once
more to the brine supply, upon which Cheshire has
since risen to its present commercial eminence as one
of the great salt-making centres of the world.</p>

<p>In 1670, a rock of natural salt was discovered on
the Marbury Estate, about one mile north of Northwich,
by one John Jackson, of Halton, who was engaged
at the time in “searching for coals on behalf of the
Lord of the Soil (or Manor, I should say), William
Marbury, of Marbury, Esquire.” The event was communicated
to the Royal Society by Mr. Adam Martindale
in a letter dated 12th December, 1670. He added that
the liquid issuing from the rock was “a vigorous sharp
brine beyond any of the springs made use of in our
salt works,” and, being asked by the Royal Society to
visit the place and send a further report, he subsequently
wrote: “The rock of salt, by the relation of the workmen,
is between 33 and 34 yards distant from the surface<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
of the earth, about 30 whereof are already digged and
they hope to be at the Flagg which covers the salt rock
about three weeks hence.... That piece of natural
salt which the instrument brought up (divers saw it,
a pure ore) was as hard as alum and as pure.”</p>

<p>The records of the rock-salt mining period are singularly
incomplete, inexact, and disappointing. It is not
known for certain which was the first mine sunk after
the discovery of the salt-bed in 1670. It may have
been the one which is described as “very near to a
small brook which drains Marbury Mere and joins the
Witton Brook, near the Buttevant Bridge on the
Marbury Estate.” Or it may have been another early
mine which was situated “close to a small runnel or
gutter which runs into this small brook near the Dairy
House Farm but passes across the land of Mr. Lyons
and over the old Marston mine.” If the curious inquirer
is not yet satisfied with these conjectures, he is further
informed that there is yet another subsidence of an old
mine, “close to the Forge Lane or road leading to
Budworth across the Fields, where the road branches
off at the cottages and salt-works of Mr. Lyons’ property
... and this mine is probably the earliest sunk.”</p>

<p>But if little is known about the beginning of the
salt-mining industry in Cheshire, there is not much more
to be learnt about its development and ultimate decay.
To-day, only the Adelaide Marston Mine at Northwich
is working, and of the nineteen mines that were open
in Cheshire in 1881, only nine were at work, while from
an undated plan and key showing the rock-salt mines
in the Northwich district, which was probably published
a few years earlier, we learn that of the fifty rock-salt
mines that had been abandoned, twelve had been sunk
to the bottom bed and the rest had been worked as
top-bed mines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span></p>

  <div class="caption">INTERIOR PENNY’S LANE MINE, NORTHWICH</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span></p>

<p>The story of the exploitation of the top and bottom
beds is one that is soon told. The top bed was worked
until the mines began to fall in and the subsequent
breaking in of fresh water converted the old workings
into brine reservoirs. In 1779, the discovery of the
lower bed of rock-salt at Lawton prompted the owners
of the Marston Mine at Northwich to sink below the
top bed in which they were working, and, in 1781, a
trial shaft which was sunk from the top mine by means
of a horse gin, demonstrated the existence of the bottom
deposit in that district. Other owners transferred their
operations from the top to the bottom bed, and for the
next fifty years practically all the rock-salt was excavated
from that source. In 1830 the roofs in these
workings began to crack, and attention was directed
to the insufficiency of the pillars by which they were
supported. A competent surveyor, who did not hesitate
to declare that the workings were in a dangerously
insecure condition, was regarded as an alarmist by the
old salt proprietors, who commissioned other “experts”
to examine the pits, and were satisfied with their
assurance that they considered each pit to be entirely
free from any danger, and that they should not hesitate
to work in any of them. Three years later the roof of
the first bottom-bed mine fell in, others collapsed in
rapid succession, and by 1840 some twenty mines had
collapsed, let in water, and become filled with brine.
In 1881, only nine rock-salt mines were at work, and
eight of these had a combined area of 123 acres.</p>

<p>Rock-salt mining in England is a dead industry, but
it will be of interest to outline very briefly the methods
that were employed in Cheshire during the comparatively
short period of its existence. The old top-bed
mines were operated, in the first place, with one shaft
to each mine, and they were ventilated by means of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
an air-pipe and a fan. A horse gin was used for winding,
but the winding-shaft in which the gin rope worked did
not go into the rock-salt, but only to within a short
distance of it, and it was out of this shaft, at a distance
of 2 or 3 yds. from the bottom, that a side drift was
driven. From this side drift a windlass pit was sunk
into the rock-salt, and it was up this windlass pit that
the rock-salt was drawn to the drift and thence taken
to and up the gin shaft, the part of the gin shaft below
the drift being used as a sump or lodgment for water.
These top-bed workings did not usually extend more
than 100 yds. from the shaft, but, as the number of
the mines increased, the workings from adjoining shafts
occasionally become connected. In this way one shaft
became a downcast and the other an upcast, and the
air-pipe and fan at each were able to be dispensed
with. The thickness of rock-salt worked averaged from
30 to 36 ft., and pillars of natural rock-salt, usually
about 5 yds. square, were left to support the roof and
superincumbent strata.</p>

<p>Although the bottom-bed mines were worked upon
the same plan, the inadequacy of the supports employed
in the top-mines was rectified by an increase in the
size of the supporting pillars and in the thickness of
the rock-salt roof that was left between them. Steam
engines with direct shafts to the bottoms of the mines
were substituted for the horse-gins and windlasses, and
improved methods were introduced for preventing water
from breaking into the shafts. Two winding-shafts
were sunk, placed about 10 to 15 yds. apart, and a
pump-shaft was sunk to the depth to which the surface
water penetrated. One of the earliest precautions
taken in the rock-salt shafts, and afterwards in brine
shafts when they came to be sunk through rock-salt,
was to protect the sides from the ravages of fresh water.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
All the shafts were roofed over to keep out rain or
snow, and the wood casing, which was originally used,
was replaced, in 1845, by cast-iron tubings, similar in
construction to those used in colliery shafts.</p>

<p>As soon as the miners had sunk the shaft to the
depth of the sole or floor of the mine and had made
an opening large enough for their purpose, they proceeded
to blast off enough rock to form a chamber about 5 ft.
high. This formed, they advanced by blasting off the
rock-salt from the face of the seam. The salt was
loaded into waggons, which ran along small railways
to the mouth of the shaft. The men engaged in blasting
the rock and squaring the walls and pillars (for these
were left quite square and well hewn) were called
<em>miners</em> ; those who loaded the trucks and conveyed
them to the shaft were <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ferriers</i>. They were a fine set
of men, and their occupation, compared with coal-mining,
was a very healthy one. The mines were of an
equable temperature, and were sufficiently warm for
the men to dispense with their shirts. Being lofty, the
air was pure, except when excessive blasting was
undertaken. The greatest number of men employed in
one pair of shafts was about eighty, and the quantity
of blasting powder used by that number in the course
of a day averaged 1 cwt. Safety fuses were seldom
used, the charge being fired by a straw filled with fine
powder, which was lighted from a candle.</p>

<p>Many of the mines were of considerable size, and
some of them increased at the rate of about an acre
annually. The quantity of rock-salt mined was small
compared with coal. No mine in the district yielded
above 40,000 tons per annum.</p>

<p>Rock-salt is more free from danger than most kinds
of mining; no explosions occur, for there are no deleterious
gases, and accidents are rare. In a general way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
the rock-salt strata are remarkably free from carbonic
acid gas, and in only one instance in Northwich, and
twice at Meadow Bank, Winsford, does fire-damp
appear to have been met with, and then only at pipe
veins and in very small quantity. There are no falls
of earth, as in coal mines, for the rock-salt is extremely
tenacious, and the miners never undermine it but blast
it, which is a much safer operation. The two great
dangers to which rock-salt mining is exposed, though
they rarely result in loss to human life, are the falling
in of the mine bodily, or of the shafts and neighbouring
earths, and the breaking in of brine either at the head
of the top-rock shaft or from old mines, long disused,
and full of brine.</p>

<p>Neither the name of the first mine that fell in, nor the
date of its collapse, is recorded. We know that a mine
in Witton fell in in 1750, and another to the north of
the Northwich Town Bridge followed in 1759, and that
many others collapsed before 1770. Lakes, or “flashes”
as they are called locally, have formed over the larger
of these sinkings, but the sites are more commonly
marked by what are known as rock-pit holes, and large
tracts of country are scored with these funnel-shaped
indentations. There can be no doubt that a number
of these old mines were worked with pillars that were
too few and slender for the purpose, and these supports
gradually weakened to their ultimate collapse under the
pressure of the superincumbent earths. As the sinking
did not take place evenly all over the mine, but most
frequently occurred near the shafts and at the greatest
distance from the sides of the cavity, the roof would
curve down towards the sinking centre and the falling-in
formed the V-shaped apertures on the surface which
are described as rock-pit holes. But, while in a percentage
of cases the collapse of the mine could be traced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
to the crashing of the pillars, the destruction of the
majority of the mines was caused directly by the influx
of water, although this water, having become saturated
with salt, would, if undisturbed, cause no further havoc
in the interior of the mine.</p>

<p>But the manufacture of white salt from brine, which
was temporarily surpassed in importance by the rock-salt
industry, was not discontinued, and a copious
supply of brine flowing over the rock head of the
upper bed, was tapped by shafts and pumped to the
surface. When, about 1850, this supply showed signs
of failing, attention was directed to the enormous
reservoirs of brine in the old inundated mines, into
which had drained a great quantity of the rock-head
brine. The attempt to pump brine out of the abandoned
workings was successful, and for some years an abundant
supply was obtained. After 1870 the pumping operations
caused further collapses, the land overlying the
mines subsided, and lakes were formed which, at
intervals, broke into the partially exhausted reservoirs,
and, pouring through the top-rock workings into the
mines in the bottom bed of salt, replenished the supply
of brine. A great collapse which occurred in the
Dunkirk district in 1880 let down the waters of Cranage
Brook and the Wadebrook, together with a huge
quantity from the river Weaver. The subsidence
resulted in the formation of a large lake, which, following
upon a later subsidence in the same area, suddenly
disappeared into the earth and literally flooded all
the underlying strata.</p>

<p>Surprise has frequently been expressed that in a salt
country in which brine has been manufactured for over
twenty centuries, the existence of the rock-salt deposits
should only have been discovered in the last two hundred
and fifty years, but it must be borne in mind that not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
only was the brine the best custodian of the secret of
its own source, but that, when the problem of the
supply had been solved, the danger of tapping and
controlling it had still to be overcome. When the
supply of brine in many of the springs was cut into, it
proved so copious that the sinkers had to flee for their
lives and to ascend the shaft among the brine. The
fact that the depth at which the brine would be
encountered was unknown, explained the inability
to provide a safeguard against the sudden inrush
of brine, but subsequent observation showed that
when the workmen met with the “flag,” or bed
of hard marlstone that existed above the top of
the rock-salt in many districts, the brine might be
expected to be found at high pressure. It was then
the practice to case the shaft sides down to the flag
to prevent the entrance of surface water, and either to
blow through the flag with powder or pierce it with
boring rods. At a later period, the shaft was sunk to
the approximate point of encounter with the brine, and
cased with iron cylinders, the bottom cylinder being
furnished with an iron bottom pierced with two pipe
holes. A column of pipes was erected in the cylinder,
and a set of boring rods was let down each pipe, so that
when the flag was bored through, the brine rose until
it attained its level in the pipes, while by means of a
tap attached to each pipe it was possible to stop the
entry of the brine and to empty the shaft.</p>

<p>In the brine-shafts employed in the case of the old
rock-salt mines, in which the brine was met with at a
much higher pressure than in the rock-head brine-shafts,
the tapping operation was attended with extraordinary
difficulties. The brine in the old workings rose to a
height corresponding with that attained by the brine
found at the rock-head, and as it had to be tapped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
through a pillar near the bottom of the old workings,
the pressure was proportionately higher. When the
holeing was first effected into the brine in the old
bottom-bed workings, the rush of the incoming brine
was so strong that it passed through the two 5 in.
bore holes and rose up a 4½ ft. shaft to a height of
67 yds. in eight minutes. The shaft for tapping this
supply of brine was sunk in a pillar of rock-salt, and a
drift, fitted with two 5 in. bore-holes, was worked
through the intervening face and into the brine. When
these bore-holes were knocked through, the brine
entered with the report of a cannon, and the engineer
and his assistant, leaving their tools behind them,
leapt into the bucket and were hastily drawn up the
shaft, closely pursued by the rising brine.</p>

<p>An improved process for tapping the brine, which
entirely removed the danger attending the operation,
was subsequently introduced. This was effected by
boring the last part of the main bore-hole through a
stuffing-box at the other end—an innovation which
prevented brine from escaping during the boring. A
drift, with the usual ⅝ in. bore-hole in advance, was
driven 61 yds. into the barrier, until the small bore-hole
showed that only 10 yds. remained between the face
and the brine that was known to be present in the old
workings. Into this remaining 10 yds. of barrier a hole
11 in. in diameter was bored until nearly through, and
a closely-fitted pipe was inserted into the hole for a
distance of 7 ft. The pipe was 10 ft. long, but at 7 ft.
from the inner end was a disc 3 ft. in diameter to rest
against the face of the drift, leaving the remaining
3 ft. of pipe in the drift. About midway between the
disc and the outer end of the pipe, were placed two
strong iron uprights, let into a trench cut 1 ft. deep in
solid rock-salt in the roof and floor to secure the pipe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
against the pressure. These two uprights were placed
close together at the top and bottom, but in the middle
they were curved so as to form a circle for the pipe to
pass between them. The face of the drift against which
the disc had to rest, having been carefully dressed, and
a disc of india-rubber covered with red lead having
been placed between the iron disc and the dressed face
of rock-salt, the iron disc was secured up tight against
the face by means of six set screws. A stop-valve was
then fitted to the outer end of the pipe, and to this, for
the temporary purpose only of completing the bore-hole,
was attached an end piece with a stuffing box
and a hole in it large enough for the bore rod to be
worked through. The bore rock was then withdrawn
and, the valve being closed, the stuffing box and the
temporary end piece were removed. A range of pipes
was attached to the stop-valve and, in this range, the
brine was taken through the old workings and up one
of the shafts to the surface.</p>

<p>Many geologists have subscribed to the theory that
the Cheshire meres were formed by subsidences which
occurred in pre-historic times, but the evidence based
on the phenomena attending the modern subsidences
proves that the latter were the result of artificial and
readily-identified causes. Leland, in 1533, reports a
sinking near Combermere and the formation of a pit
containing salt-water; in 1657 a small sinking occurred
at Bickley, near Malpas; and a third took place in 1713
at Weaver Hall, to the south of Winsford. No traces of
any of these subsidences now remain, but, from the
descriptions handed down to us, these sinkings belonged
to the class of funnel-shaped holes and were of limited
diameter and no great depth.</p>

<p>Of the modern subsidences, which are of three kinds,
we have no documentary evidence prior to 1777, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
the earliest distinct record belongs to the year 1790.
From that time to the present day this class of sinking
has continued to increase in extent year by year. In
1790 the sinking portion along the Witton Brook was
recorded as being 130 yds. long by 90 yds. wide. In
1837, the subsidence had obtained an area of 1,230 yds.
long by 130 yds. wide. In 1811, about 20 statute acres
in Witton commenced sinking, and in the ensuing
thirty-three years some portions of this area had sunk
24 ft. In 1880, the piece of water called the Top of
the Brook had subsided over an area of 4,370 ft. by
1,470 ft., and in the same year it was estimated that no
less than 2,700 acres of land in Northwich and Winsford
were inundated.</p>

<p>These modern subsidences usually consist of funnel-shaped
holes caused by the falling-in of top-rock mines,
and of trough-shaped hollows which cannot be connected
with rock-salt mining, and are frequently found in places
far removed from the localities of the old workings.
Of two dozen subsidences, two are nearly four miles
distant from the nearest old workings or from the
brine shafts, fifteen are upwards of two miles, and only
one is less than a mile from either a mine or a pumping
station. The subsidences could not be caused by
volcanic action or the shock of earthquakes, as nothing
of the kind has occurred in the districts, and it is
impossible to explain them by the action of natural
brine springs running to waste in the brooks or rivers,
because it is known that no such springs now exist,
while evidence accumulated from all parts of the world
confirms the conclusion that where brine springs escape
into the streams, no subsidence has ever occurred.
Yet it is evident in Cheshire that some subterranean
denudation must be taking place which is removing
portions of the lower strata and allowing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
super-incumbent earths to sink into the excavations
thus made. Many theories have been advanced to
explain the phenomena, but even those people whose
interests have caused them to seek for alternative
causes must realize that it can only be attributed to
the simple and most obvious agency.</p>

<p>When the number of brine pits was multiplied and
the natural springs of a weak solution of salt decreased
in volume, it was necessary to sink down to the rock-head
brine, which was a highly-saturated solution consisting
of one part salt to three parts water. When this
supply is pumped up, its place is taken by fresh water,
which, flowing over the rock-beds, takes up its quota
of salt on its way to the pumping shafts, and is raised
to the surface in the form of brine.</p>

<p>It is not the presence of water over the beds of salt
or in the old salt workings which causes the damage,
because when such water has taken up salt to the
extent of a fourth of its bulk, it remains inactive and
makes no further ravages upon the mineral earths with
which it is in contact. But when the saturated brine
is pumped up and its place is taken with a new supply
of water which collects its tribute from the salt strata,
and that water, in its turn, is raised, to be replaced by
more, and when it is known that each 100 tons of water
that traverses the salt-bed to the pumps carries away
with it 25 tons of solid earth, the work of destruction
that is continually going on is explained.</p>

<p>It may be convenient to explain at this point that
the subsidences caused by this simple operation of
removing rock-salt from the earth in the form of brine
are divided into three classes, <span class="locked">viz.—</span></p>

<p>1. Shallow troughs, with sides not terraced or broken up.</p>

<p>2. Very shallow depressions extending over considerable
areas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span></p>

<p>3. Deep troughs, much broken up, and with stepped
or terraced sides.</p>

<p>With these three classes in mind, it is easy to follow
the results of the action of the subterranean brine and
associate the causes with the effects produced. At first
the water flowed over the salt in irregular channels
and reached the pumping centres by devious routes,
but after a time it made defined courses for itself
exactly as the rainfall carves out for itself channels
on the surface of the earth. These underground
streams of brine all gravitate towards the pumps,
widening and deepening as the continually renewed
water takes up its supply of salt. Where the earths
overlying these brine “runs” are not too tenacious,
they soon follow the hollow or trough formed on the
surface of the salt bed, and a corresponding hollow or
trough is formed on the surface of the ground. Where
the hollow forms at an early stage, it rarely attains any
considerable depth, for the sinking earths impede the
course of the flowing brine stream and cause the fluid
to spread and be diffused over a wider area. These
subsidences are the shallow troughs, not stepped or
terraced on the sides, and are best seen in streets and
roads where the weight of the houses and the constant
passage of traffic cause the earths to gradually follow
the wasting surface of the salt. Where, at a considerable
distance from the shafts, the water has not formed for
itself a definite channel, it percolates over a wide area.
The denudation in such cases is more generally spread,
and a very extensive shallow trough or basin is formed.
Again, where the pumping stations are close together,
or in the same line, the various rivulets or streams of
brine converge into one broad and deep channel, in
which the denudation proceeds with great rapidity.
The magnitude of these channels causes the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
super-incumbent ground to subside swiftly, forming deep
troughs with stepped or terraced sides, where the earths
have broken away in huge masses. Where the earth
consists of strong marls and a kind of flagstone they are
very tenacious and remain suspended for a considerable
time over these deeper cavities. When they will bear
no longer, a sudden fall occurs in one spot, and tens of
thousands of tons of suspended earths fall into the
trough below, forcing out the stream of brine at the
weaker places and leaving a huge, crater-shaped hole
on the surface, which fills with water.</p>

  <img src="images/i_p111.jpg" width="1726" height="1056" alt="">
  <div class="caption">REMARKABLE SUBSIDENCE IN NORTHWICH</div></div>

<p>In addition to the three classes of subsidences already
mentioned, there is another which is the result of a
combination of collapses of the surface earth caused
by the rock-salt mining operations, and the denudation
of subterranean strata caused by the pumping of brine.
The pumping from the reservoirs formed by the flooding
of the old mines does not empty these huge receptacles,
as the place of the brine is continuously retaken by
fresh water, which naturally gravitates to these centres
and proceeds to dissolve and take up its quota of rock-salt.
When a subsidence occurs on the site of these
old workings it is of the most destructive nature, and
as all the top-rock mines were in the neighbourhood of
streams and brooks, the surface waters flow into the
cavity until it is filled to the level of the earth and
allows the streams to pursue their proper course. But
as fast as the fresh water becomes saturated and is
pumped to the surface, the overlying stream or brook
lets in further supplies of fresh water to fill the vacuum,
and the work of internal destruction is followed by
further subsidences of the suspended earths.</p>

<p>The immense bodies of water in the neighbourhood
of Northwich and Winsford, locally called “Flashes,”
which cover a total area of many hundreds of acres,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
are the work of subsidences. The Flashes are not
shallow swamps, but lakes varying in depth over many
acres, from a few yards to 50 ft. The largest Flash,
known as the Top of the Brook and resembling the letter
<span class="sans">L</span> in shape, has a length in each arm of about half a mile,
an average breadth of a quarter of a mile, and attains
a depth of 150 ft. In an account of these subsidences,
written in 1879, we read: “The whole of the surrounding
district still sinks rapidly, and year by year the water
covers more ground. The land subsides gradually here;
but when we go a quarter of a mile to the north-east
of the Top of the Brook, we come across a subsidence
of a still more alarming character. Here the ground
sinks bodily in immense masses to a great depth.
A tiny brook or ditch that a child could skip across
passed over flat fields some five years ago. Gradually
the land began to sink, and cracks opened in the surface
right across the course of the brook. The water went
down the crevices. The land immediately sank more
rapidly; huge cracks, wide enough for a man to slip
down, formed, and very soon a district extending fully
one thousand feet in length by as many in breadth,
sank rapidly to a depth of forty or fifty feet in the
centre, and was filled up to a certain height with water,
which covered the hedges and trees. At times cracks
opened in the bottom of this lake, and the whole of
the water rushing rapidly below, caused still more
extensive sinking.”</p>

<p>One of the most extraordinary subsidences, which
was described in <cite>Chambers’s Journal</cite>, occurred in Dunkirk,
on the outskirts of Northwich, in December, 1880. The
earliest intimation of impending disturbance on an
unusual scale was a rumbling subterranean noise, the
violent bubbling of the water in all the surrounding
pools, and the uprushing of air and foul gas through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
rifts which its passage tore in the ground. It was
quickly discovered that Wincham Brook, a channel of
water nearly 20 ft. in width, had broken into the
earth about 1,000 ft. from its entrance into the Top of
the Brook, and the uprush of air from the old mines,
was caused by the force of the descending waters.
A series of alarming, but comparatively small, subterranean
displacements caused extensive rifts in the
ground about Ashton Salt-works, and these were
followed by a sudden explosion in a neighbouring pool,
which ejected a geyser of mud and water some 30 ft.
into the air. In the ruin that ensued, stacks of timber,
an engine and boiler, a salt pan, and other material
disappeared into the gaping earth, and a massive
chimney stack, some 90 ft. high and 9 ft. square at
the base, tilted towards the centre of subsidence and
collapsed with a terrible crash. Scarcely had this
subsidence ceased, says the writer in <cite>Chambers’s Journal</cite>,
“when an enormous sinking of the whole of Ashton’s
Old Rock Pit Hole and the surrounding land, for an
area of over five hundred feet in diameter, took place,
leaving two very deep holes. The land was riven and
cracked all round, and fell in steps of two feet. Over
ten thousand tons of water went down into the subterranean
cavities. A huge brine cistern was riven in
two, and the brine all lost; and two large brick kilns
cut completely in halves, and the bricks scattered about.
The whole surface of the Weaver and the Top of the
Brook was lowered fully a foot over one hundred and
sixty acres in about four hours; and if we add to this
the whole of the water of the Wincham Brook for
twelve hours, we shall find, on a careful computation,
that not less than six hundred thousand tons of water
rushed below.”</p>

<p>From the time of the “Great Subsidence,” as this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
event is described, the sinking has been continuous
throughout the locality. In some places meadows have
been converted into swamps, roads have sunk fully
30 ft. below their original level, and small brooks have
become lakes of many acres in extent; sunken and distorted
fences, roads, and streams are common objects
of the country-side, the tenure of pastoral lands is precarious,
and property is valueless for building purposes;
and nothing but its inexhaustible reserves of brine
saves the district from abandonment as a place accursed.</p>

<p>The shallow, gradual, almost imperceptible subsidences
which occurred in the neighbourhood of
the towns of Northwich and Winsford were at first
infrequent and of comparative unimportance, but as
time went on the damage to property increased so
rapidly that, in 1860, the house-owners of Northwich
combined in an unsuccessful attempt to obtain legal
redress. By 1880, many parts of the towns were
rendered unfit for habitation. In Northwich alone,
nearly 400 houses and other property to the value of
over £100,000 were more or less seriously affected,
while water-mains, sewers, and gas-pipes were being
continually repaired; houses were condemned, pulled
down and rebuilt, and bridges had to be raised. The
rents of many lots of property were absorbed in keeping
them in repair, and in some districts property had been
raised and rebuilt three times in eleven years. “The
area of the mischief is extending yearly,” wrote Mr.
Thomas Ward in 1881, “and a larger proportion of
property is becoming affected, and more and more land
is sinking beneath the water and increasing the area of
the already existing extensive lakes. Very few, except
those conversant with the district, have the slightest
knowledge of the amount of suffering caused to property
owners by this subsiding of the land.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span></p>

<p>For over half a century the appearance of Northwich,
with its undulating streets, its ramshackle, dilapidated
houses, its fissured walls, and its system of shoring and
bolting-up of property to postpone as long as possible
its inevitable condemnation and demolition, has presented
a tragico-comic spectacle. “If a stranger were
to be set down some morning in the town of Northwich,”
wrote a <cite>Times</cite> correspondent, “without any previous
knowledge of its peculiarities, he would be struck with
a startling and novel spectacle. He would see buildings
of every sort, from the humble, two-storeyed cottage of
the artisan to the solidly built church or chapel, standing
many degrees out of the perpendicular, and suggestive,
all of them, were it not for the props and iron stays
with which they are secured, of some recent convulsion
of nature. In main thoroughfares and back streets
alike there are houses whose sloping floors and cracked
walls would lend considerable colour to such an effort
of the imagination. The inhabitants seem to take this
tumble-down state of their dwellings quite as a matter
of course. They have, in fact, to make the best of a
condition of things from which there is absolutely no
escape. The effects described are produced, not indeed
by any sudden catastrophe, but by a slow, though
equally effective process of subsidence, which may be
detected in continuous operation over nearly the whole
area of the Cheshire salt field, and which will continue
to operate so long as the earth yields its vast stores of
salt for human consumption.”</p>

<p>But although newspaper representatives could philosophize
upon the matter-of-fact spirit in which the
inhabitants of the salt towns faced existence in their
tumble-down surroundings, and the salt proprietors
desired that they should make the best of a condition
of things from which they wished them to believe there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
was absolutely no amelioration or escape, a feeling of
resentment was rapidly growing in the neighbourhood.
The people of Northwich and Winsford were being
pumped out of their houses and out of their lands, and
the future held every promise of a continuation and
extension of the damage. Lord Delamere, who, as an
owner and letter of salt lands, benefited by the brine
industry and suffered from the depredation it wrought,
admitted the damage and the cause thereof. Indeed,
nobody but the salt proprietors doubted that the
pumpers were wholly responsible for the destruction,
and most people recognized that their wrong-doing
was twofold in character. Standing on the ancient
assumption in law that everything beneath a man’s
property belongs to the owner, the owners of property
in the affected districts contended that they were not
only being deprived of the rock-salt which legally
belonged to them, but were further despoiled by having
their land made worthless by the abstraction of the salt
for which they received no payment. The justice of
the protest was obvious, and it became a public question
how far these operations, useful in themselves, but
involving consequences of a disastrous nature, should
be allowed to proceed. In December, 1880, the <cite>Daily
News</cite> asked who was to compensate the sufferers, who
had neither caused nor contributed to the disaster.</p>

<p>Following the failure of the property owners to obtain
compensation from the salt proprietors for the damage
attributable to the pumping operations, an application
was made to the Trustees of the River Weaver to devote
a portion of their surplus revenue for compensation
purposes. The application was refused, and an appeal
to Quarter Sessions failed. The evil was allowed to
drag on until 1871, when the Board of Trade, in response
to representations made to them by the Northwich<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
Salt Chamber of Commerce, instructed Mr. Joseph
Dickinson to report upon the salt districts of Cheshire.
Mr. Dickinson, one of the most eminent Inspectors of
Mines in the service of the Government, after a prolonged
investigation, reported his conclusions that the subsidences
and the resulting damages to property were
caused by the pumping of brine, which constituted a
public danger and inflicted heavy losses upon many
persons totally unconnected with the salt industry.
A further report by Colonel Cox, corroborating the
conclusions arrived at by Mr. Dickinson, came before
Parliament in 1879, and upon the recommendation of
the Local Government Board, the local Boards decided
to promote the Cheshire Salt Districts Compensation
Bill, “to make provision for the assessment, levy, and
application for compensation for damage by subsidence
of land in the salt districts of the County of Cheshire,
and for other purposes.”</p>

<p>The salt proprietors exerted every effort to frustrate
the plans of the promoters of the Bill; they declared
that a tax upon salt would cripple the trade and ruin
the entire neighbourhood; they endeavoured to create
local ill-feeling by insisting that the movement was an
attempt of the property-owners to saddle the ratepayers
with the expense of the proposed measure. Briefly
stated, the case that the promoters were asked to
make required them to prove (<i>a</i>) the subsidence in the
salt district; (<i>b</i>) that the subsidence was caused by the
pumping of brine for the manufacture of salt; (<i>c</i>) that
the subsidence was of a most extensive and serious
character, and affected the property of persons deriving
no benefit either from the manufacture of salt in the
form of compensation from the salt manufacturers for
the salt extracted, or for damage done to the property
by such abstraction; (<i>d</i>) that there was no legal remedy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
for the injury suffered; and, finally, (<i>e</i>) that the moneys
required to adequately compensate for the injury done,
if levied upon the manufacture of salt, would not
injuriously affect the salt industry.</p>

<p>A copy of the Bill was lodged in December, 1880; it
was read a first and second time on 21st January and
4th February, 1881, and referred to a Select Committee,
which commenced sitting on 5th May, and on the 20th
of the same month announced their unanimous opinion
that the preamble of the Bill had not been proved.
In the preamble of the Bill it was estimated that a
contribution not exceeding threepence for every ton
of salt in brine in the district covered by the Act would
be sufficient to provide the required compensation.
The opponents of the Bill declared that a compensation
tax upon the salt trade would severely injure the
industry and act as a restraint upon trade; they put
forward expert witnesses to contend that if the brine—which
they contended was produced by rainfall percolating
through the superincumbent strata and reaching
the salt—was not pumped out, it would run away to
the sea, and the consequent subsidence of land and
injury to property would not be arrested. The theory
that brine, in quantity sufficient for the manufacture
of 1,600,000 tons of salt per annum would, without
pumping, have been carried away into the rivers by
natural agency and deposited in the sea, was supported
by such ingenious misstatement and misrepresentation,
and the fictitious instances of brine springs overflowing
and causing damage in other parts of the world were
quoted with so much specious authority that they
succeeded in wrecking the Bill.</p>

<p>After a further ten years of continued subsidences
and attendant damage to public and private property,
the Brine Pumping (Compensation for Subsidence) Bill<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
was introduced in 1891, to authorize the formation of
Compensation Districts and Boards, with power to
levy a yearly rate not exceeding threepence per 1,000
gallons of brine pumped. Shortly after the passing of
the Bill, the action of Northwich, which memorialized
for the formation of the whole of the County of Cheshire
into one district for purposes of compensation, led to
an inquiry by the Local Government Board, as the
result of which Middlewich and Sandbach were excluded.
The Provisional Order uniting Northwich and Winsford
in one area was opposed by Winsford, and a Select
Committee of the House, in 1893, quashed the Provisional
Order and made Northwich an independent
compensation district.</p>

<p>The next great struggle in the salt district, known
locally as the Battle of the Brine, arose out of the action
of the Salt Union, which, in 1909, enlarged its works at
Weston Point with the intention of manufacturing salt
at that place from brine pumped at Marston, near
Northwich, 11 miles distant. In pursuance of their
policy of stalling off competition and safeguarding their
monopoly, the Salt Union, in 1890, had successfully
petitioned against the Bill that was promoted to obtain
powers to convey brine from Cheshire to be made into
salt at Widnes, in Lancashire, and at Middlewich they
had obtained an injunction to restrain trade competitors
from laying pipes under one of the streets of the town
for the conveyance of brine from their own pumps to
their own salt-pans. In 1766, 1833, and 1861, the Trent
and Mersey Canal, the Grand Junction Railway, and
the West Cheshire Railway, respectively, received
authorizations from Parliament, but in each instance
a clause was inserted prohibiting the several companies
from conveying or permitting to be conveyed in or
upon any part of their properties, any brine for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
making of salt to any district beyond the district in
which salt was then made. In 1884, when the London
and North-Western Railway sought to gain the repeal
of the brine clause in order to enable brine to be carried
from one salt township to another adjoining, Parliament
refused to sanction even such a limited modification of
the prohibition. The logical objection which the salt
districts opposed to the removal from the several
pumping centres of the brine upon which the prosperity
of the towns entirely depended, had thus consistently
been upheld by Parliament, but in the face of these
facts, and of their previous attitude on the subject,
the Salt Union insisted upon their right to carry brine
from Marston to Weston Point, and announced their
intention to defend their position to the utmost of
their power.</p>

<p>It must be explained that the Marbury Pipe Line
had been laid in 1882 by the Mersey Salt &amp; Brine
Company, who carried it, by agreement, across lands
belonging to private landowners and over a canal
belonging to the North Stafford Railway. The railway
made a formal protest, but an amicable settlement
was ultimately reached by which the Mersey Salt
Company agreed to pay the North Stafford Company
£5 a year and to remove the pipe on receipt of a three
months’ notice. The railway company appear to have
persisted with their opposition in order to force an
admission from the Mersey Company that they possessed
no permanent right to carry the pipe across their canal,
but the concern was of such trifling importance that it
was practically ignored by the people of the district,
and for twenty years after the property of the Mersey
Salt Company and the Marbury Brine Pipe had been
acquired by the Salt Union, the question of the removal
of brine from the neighbourhood in which it was raised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
had found all classes of the salt community united against
such proposals. But with the completion of the works
at Weston Point, and the enlargement of the Marbury
Pipe and the installation of powerful engines, capable of
driving millions of gallons of brine from Marbury to
be converted into salt at the sea-board, a new menace
was organized against which the Urban Authorities and
Local Councils made a long and spirited, if fruitless,
resistance.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1910, the North Stafford Railway
served the Salt Union with a notice to remove their
pipe line from the Trent and Mersey Canal by the end
of the following March, and the Salt Union proving
obdurate, the towns of Northwich, Winsford, and
Middlewich promoted the Brine Pumping (Cheshire)
Bill, “to regulate the conveyance of brine pumped,
raised and gotten” in the county. The original draft,
which proposed to permit the removal of brine by pipe
to a distance of three miles within the county from the
place at which it was raised, was amended to permit
manufacturers to carry brine by pipe from one set of
works to another in their own occupation, and they
further attempted to meet the alleged rights of the
Salt Union by the insertion of a clause allowing the
Marbury Pipe to be used for the conveyance of brine
to the extent of 250 million gallons a year. But the
Salt Union declined all conciliatory overtures, and
combated the Bill before the Select Committee on the
grounds that it was a proposal to alter the common
law of England and interfere with the sacred rights of
property. The injury that was sought to be done,
not only to the Salt Union but to the export trade of
the country, was enlarged upon, and the Committee
may have been impressed by the assurance that the
Union, so far from intending to leave Winsford and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
Northwich, expected to do an even greater trade in those
districts in the future than had been done there in the
past. In the result, the Salt Union’s insistence upon
the legality of a course of action which they had previously
denounced and opposed as totally illegal,
carried so much weight with the Select Committee,
that they made an unsavoury meal of the Parliamentary
decisions of 1766, 1833, 1861, 1890, 1891, and 1893,
and announced that the Bill could not proceed.</p>

<span class="subhead">LATEST METHODS OF SALT-MAKING</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">In</span> tracing the development of the salt-making industry
in this country, it will be observed that, until the last
quarter of a century, the old open-pan system defied
improvement, and the salt-makers from generation to
generation successfully resisted the endeavours of all
who suggested innovations or hinted that better methods
could be introduced in the manufacture. It is true
that experiments were made with the sizes and arrangement
of the pans, that coal replaced wood and straw as
fuel, that the locomotive superseded the wain as a means
of transporting salt from the works to the markets, and
that pumps were employed instead of buckets to raise
the brine and deposit it in the cisterns which supplied
the pans; but these several developments produced
no change in the system of manufacture, which consisted
of lighting a fire beneath a pan of brine, driving off
the water in the form of vapour, and collecting the salt
crystals that form and sink to the bottom of the pan.
The salt-men were devoted to their primitive, rule-of-thumb
methods, and the most enterprising among them
regarded the process as unimprovable. In the construction
of salt-works there was no attempt at engineering
exactness; the size of the pans was regulated roughly
by the dimensions of the plates of which they were made;
and the heights of the brickwork of the furnaces, etc.,
was usually reckoned by courses of bricks.</p>

<p>The fireman, the real salt-maker, whose business
it was to attend to the fires and see that the proper
degree of heat was maintained to produce the variety<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
of salt required, did his work almost entirely by rule-of-thumb.
It was only rarely that a thermometer was
used. The technical knowledge acquired by experience
enabled a man to see at a glance whether the pan was
working properly, and the quantity and quality of the
salt showed whether his work had been well or ill done.
The late Thomas Ward was a greatly respected authority,
one of the most reliable experts of the Salt Union, and
a voluminous writer and indefatigable lecturer on every
aspect of the subject of salt, but he failed to persuade
himself that it was even thinkable that the open-pan
system should ever be abandoned in favour of a more
scientific, more rapid, or more economical process.</p>

<p>Mr. Ward admitted that the process was archaic,
but he was at pains to demonstrate that the trade was
justified in desiring it to remain so. He argued that
the price of salt was so low, and the product was so
bulky, that costly and elaborate apparatus was both
inappropriate and ineffective. He compared the life
of an ordinary open salt-pan with that of any of the
innumerable patented pans that had been tried, and
found that the ancient article produced salt at less
cost than the patent contraptions, and was far easier
to repair. “The chief business of the salt manufacturer,”
Mr. Ward wrote in 1894, “is to utilize to the
best purpose, for the production of salt, the heat obtained
from the fuel. To this end, innumerable patents have
been taken out, but few have been so successful as the
simple application of direct heat to open pans. The
method seems a very primitive one, and most visitors
to salt-works think they can improve upon what they
consider a rude, antiquated system. I have had
brought before me, and have seen working, scores of
patented plans. In all, or nearly all, the idea was to
economize heat; and if the whole of salt manufacturing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
consisted in evaporating the greatest quantity of water
with the least quantity of fuel, doubtless many of the
schemes would succeed instead of fail, as they do now.”</p>

<p>Since the open-pan system of manufacturing salt
from brine was in general and uninterrupted use in
this country from the time of Julius Caesar to within a
few years ago, we must study the interim developments
from direct-fire to vacuum pan evaporation in the
industry of the State of New York. The salt springs
in New York State were discovered by Jesuit missionaries
about the middle of the seventeenth century,
but the manufacture of salt on a commercial scale was
not begun until 1788, when the industry was established
in the vicinity of Syracuse. Solar salt is still manufactured
in large quantities at Syracuse, where the
evaporating surface covers an area of over 12,000,000
square feet, and the season’s output amounts to about
3,500,000 bushels of salt, but between the solar and
the vacuum processes the American salt-men have
exploited the Pan and the Kettle processes of direct-fire
evaporation, and the Steam Kettle and the Grainger
processes of steam evaporation; all of which methods
are employed to-day in the State of New York.</p>

<p>In the Pan process, several pans, having a width of
20 to 24 ft., a length of 100 ft. in two sections, and a
depth of 12 in., are placed under one roof. Adjoining
this front row of pans at the back are arranged a second
row of pans, 20 to 24 ft. wide, 30 ft. long, and 12 in.
deep, set from 12 to 16 in. higher than the front pans,
to enable the easy transfer of brine by syphon from the
back to the front pan. The grates are 3 to 4 ft. wide,
by 5 to 6 ft. long, and the pan bottoms, which are
directly over the fires are protected from a too intense
heat by fire-brick arches, which decrease in width from
the front to the back of the pan, while the air spaces<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
between the arches increase in width in the same
direction. Beyond 20 ft. from the front of the first
section of the pan they cease altogether. To convey
the heat as close to the pan bottom as possible, beyond
the last arch, the flues are usually filled in with earth
or plaster, and thus the distance between the pan and
flue bottom is between 3 and 4 ft., or even less, at the
end of the first pan, where a perpendicular wall, called
a bridge wall, reduces the space to about 1½ to 2 ft.,
through which the products of combustion pass under
the back pan and finally into a common chimney.</p>

<p>After the pans are properly cleansed they are white-washed
with a thin milk of lime to prevent their rusting
before they become thoroughly heated; the fires are
started, and the pans are filled by syphons to a depth
of about 6 in. with brine from the back pans. The
former are so inserted that a constant flow of brine
passes from the back pans into the last section of the
front pans, and from these under the partition into the
first section. Into the back pan flows a constant
stream from the outside cistern, until the front pans
are sufficiently full, when the flow is stopped. After a
sufficient amount of salt has collected in the first section
of the front pan it is removed to the “drip” for drainage.
This is called drawing or raking the pans. The front
pans are refilled from the back pan in which the brine
has become considerably heated, and thus is prevented
a too rapid cooling of the brine in the front pan, which
would seriously interfere with the formation of a properly
grained salt. For the same reason, the partition is
placed in the front pan, since it prevents any cold brine
from coming suddenly into the first section, but is
compelled to enter at the bottom of the pan, where the
temperature is at the highest.</p>

<p>For the purpose of aiding the formation of fine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
grained salt, butter, specially prepared soft soap,
gelatine, or white glue are added, and when this variety
of salt is made the pans are drawn every 45 to 60
minutes. In the manufacture of coarser grained salt,
the drawing of the pans take place at intervals of from
two to twelve hours, while the temperature is reduced
from 229° F. to as low as 148° F., according to the
size of the grain.</p>

<p>The Kettle process, which is exclusively employed on
the Onondaga Salt Reservation, consists of from 60 to
100 hemispherical cast-iron kettles suspended or hung
on “lugs” or pins in two parallel flues, called arches,
ending in one chimney, which has a height of 50 to
100 ft., according to the length of the flues. In front
the arches are provided with cast-iron, flat-topped
grates, 3 ft. in width and 5 ft. long, perforated with
holes ⅜ in. in diameter and 1 in. apart. These are well
adapted for the burning of anthracite dust, which is
now exclusively used for the purpose. The necessary
artificial draught is furnished by a pressure blower.
The kettles are from 23 to 26 in. in depth, and from
3 ft. 10 in. to 4 ft. 2 in. in diameter, with a capacity
of 100 to 150 gallons. The distance from the bottom
of the kettle to the top of the grate is 3 ft. 6 in., with a
solid fire-brick arch in each, extending somewhat
beyond the length of the grate. The distance from the
bottom of the kettle to the crown of this arch is 10 to
12 in. Beyond the grate the fire-brick arches are constructed
in sections, the air spaces between the arches
increasing in size with the advancing distance from
the grates. This construction allows the heated gases
to pass through these spaces without striking the kettle
bottoms directly. While the distance between the
bottom of the front kettle and the top of the grate is
3 ft. 6 in., these flues decrease in depth as they advance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
towards the chimney, so that under the last kettle the
distance is but 6 or 8 in. The kettles are hung as close
as possible with their rims against each other, and the
space between the walls and kettles above the lugs is
properly covered by masonry, etc., for the purpose of
confining all the heat as much as possible within the
two arches.</p>

<p>The system of kettles is fed by means of a conduit
connected with large wooden cisterns situated outside
the building and sufficiently elevated to supply the
brine contained therein by gravity to the kettles in
the block.</p>

<p>The manufacture proper of salt is commenced by
lighting the fires under the kettles and filling them
partly with brine as soon as they become warm, and
from within 3 to 4 in. of the top when evaporation has
well commenced. When salt commences to separate,
the pan is withdrawn and the evaporation is allowed
to go on undisturbed till a sufficient amount of salt has
separated, when the contents of the kettle are well
stirred with the ladle and dipped into the basket resting
on the so-called basket-sticks laid across the rim of
the kettle. While the process of taking the salt from
the kettle is going on, the workman opens the faucet
for a few minutes to add some fresh brine to the concentrated
pickle of the kettle, and washes the salt, so
to speak, with this mixture, thereby freeing it as much
as possible from the adhering calcium sulphate and the
calcium and magnesium chlorides.</p>

<div id="il_18" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 36em;">
  <img src="images/i_p131.jpg" width="1732" height="1062" alt="">
  <div class="caption">ILLUSTRATION OF FOUR SCOTT PATENT DOUBLE EFFECT SALT EVAPORATORS, WITH AUTOMATIC
SALT DISCHARGERS, SALT CONVEYERS, AND HYDRO-EXTRACTORS</div></div>

<p>The panning process, though carried out in the best
possible manner, will not completely remove from the
kettle all the separated calcium sulphate, but some of it,
together with separated salt, will bake on the bottom
and sides, forming an incrustation constantly increasing
in thickness, though at every refilling of the kettle with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
fresh brine much of this adhering salt re-dissolves.
This incrustation increases much more rapidly in the
front kettles than in those nearer to the chimney, since,
a front kettle is usually drawn every 4 or 5 hours, while
a back kettle often requires from 24 to 36 hours before a
sufficient amount of salt has separated. Moreover, a
front kettle holds 150 gallons of brine, while those
nearest the chimney contain but 100 gallons. Usually,
in 5 or 6 days the incrustation becomes so thick that
it interferes very materially with the evaporation,
causing a great loss of fuel, as gypsum is one of the
poorest conductors of heat. The workman therefore
draws the salt from the kettle, removes the remaining
brine to within a few gallons, and refills the kettle with
fresh water. After a continuous boiling of about half
an hour, the greater part of the adhering salt has
dissolved and the rest of the incrustation can easily
be removed.</p>

<p>The time a salt block is in operation is between 10
and 15 days, and the manufactured salt, according to
the State laws, remains undisturbed for 14 days for
drainage. A salt block usually cools sufficiently in
24 hours for the kettles, grates, arches, etc., to be
properly cleaned and made ready for the next run,
so that about two runs can be accomplished per month.
The quantity of salt produced in 24 hours in a good
salt block, with average good coal dust and brine, is
from 500 to 600 bushels of 56 lbs. each, and the amount
obtainable by the burning of 1 ton of 2,000 lb. of this
fuel varies from 45 to 50 bushels.</p>

<p>There are two salt blocks at the Wyoming Valley,
at Warsaw, in which the Onondaga kettles are heated
by steam instead of direct fire. Here, in place of the
brick arches in which the kettles are hung at Syracuse,
they are supported by a framework, and each kettle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
is surrounded by a steam jacket covered with a non-conductor.
Moreover, the kettle is made much thinner
for the better transmission of the heat. The steam
enters the jacket at the upper end of the kettle at one
side, and the condensed water escapes by a valve
below it, to be returned to the steam boiler. The
method of manufacture of the salt does not differ in
any particular from the Onondaga method.</p>

<p>The grainer or Michigan process is, like the “kettle
method,” a purely American invention, and consists
in passing live or exhaust steam through a set of iron
pipes immersed in long, shallow wooden or iron vats.
These vats rest on a strong wooden frame. They are
from 100 to 150 ft. long, usually 12 ft. wide, and from
20 to 24 in. deep; provided with four or six steam pipes
having a diameter of 4 to 5 in., and hung on pendants
4 to 6 in. above the bottom of the vats. These pipes
are within a few feet of the same length as the grainer,
and so arranged that the salt can be conveniently
removed towards the outer side of the grainer.</p>

<p>To obtain the best effect in a grainer system, the
temperature of the heated brine is kept at or near the
boiling-point when no lifting or removal of salt is in
progress. To do this an abundance of high-pressure
steam must first be supplied to the grainers, and,
secondly, the constant supply of brine required for the
grainers while evaporation is going on, must enter at
a temperature but little lower than that of the brine in
the grainer. For this purpose two large tanks, called
settlers, are employed, which are usually as long and
wide as the grainers, but 6 ft. deep, and provided with
four rows of steam pipes about 1 ft. above the floor to
heat the cold brine drawn into them from the outside
cisterns as required. Although the six rows of steam
pipes in the grainer have an entire length of from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
550 to 750 ft. (suspended in the brine 4 to 6 in. above
the bottom of the grainer and with 8 to 10 in. of brine
above them) and a heating surface of from 700 to 1,000
square feet, a great deal of the steam supplied to them
is not condensed, and, therefore, passes from the grainer
pipes into the settler pipes (sometimes passing through
a steam trap to separate the condensed water) to heat
the brine of the settlers.</p>

<p>The main difficulty with which the manufacturers of
New York State have to contend is the calcium sulphate.
In fact, it is this impurity which causes the interruption
of the process, and the laborious cleaning out, whether
the kettle, the pan, the grainer, or the vacuum pan is
used. It not only entails a great loss of heat in consequence
of its slow conductivity, but it also causes
the overheating of the metal exposed to direct fire,
wherever this is employed. Suggestions and experiments
have been made to overcome this difficulty,
involving the expenditure of great sums of money, but
without any practical results as far as mechanical
means are concerned.</p>

<p>From the time of the introduction of the open-pan
system in Cheshire, until the beginning of the present
century it was found impossible, owing to the nature
of the furnaces employed in the process, to maintain a
sufficiently high and uniform temperature to produce
salt which, without grinding, is marketed as finest
table salt, or to make more than 2 tons of salt from
the consumption of 1 ton of coal. Experiments for
the purpose of economizing fuel appeared destined to
perpetual failure, and the hand-stoking of the furnaces
entailed so many variations of temperature that the
production of salt crystals of uniform size was impossible.
Then, within the same decade, two processes were
invented which, between them, solved the problems that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
had hitherto eluded all the efforts of the scientist, the
engineer, and the practical salt-man.</p>

<p>In order to understand the advantages secured by
the operation of the Vacuum System, which comes to
us from the United States, it must be remembered that,
under atmospheric pressure, brine boils at a temperature
of 226° F., whereas in a vacuum of 28 in. mercury, the
boiling temperature is reduced to about 100° F. It will
thus be seen that evaporation <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">in vacuo</i> renders it possible
to use multiple effect apparatus without causing unduly
high pressure in the first vessel, and it has this further
advantage, that the low-pressure steam, in passing
through the evaporation gives up its latent heat,
whereas if the steam went to the condenser direct from
the engine, the heat employed in the steam engine
would be only the difference between the heat contained
in steam at 170 lb. and the steam at 5 lb. pressure.
By multiple effect evaporation, a great economy in the
amount of steam required is effected. Between the
evaporation of brine and that of other liquors, the chief
difference to be noted is that in the multiple effect
system, each pan or unit is supplied with its brine
independently of the others, and graining goes on in the
pans, whereas in concentrating other liquors the pans
are fed from the first to the second and from the second
to the third. The removal of the salt from each pan
has, therefore, to be arranged for. The method of
working a triple-effect plant may be briefly described
as <span class="locked">follows—</span></p>

<p>Each of the three pans having been charged with
brine to the proper level, exhaust steam from the
engines is admitted to the calandria of the first pan in
which the highest temperature is maintained. The brine
in this pan becomes quickly heated, and the steam given
off enters the calandria of the second pan, where it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
serves to raise the temperature of the brine. After
doing its work in the second stage, the steam is condensed,
and thus creates a partial vacuum in the first
pan. The atmospheric pressure being thus reduced,
violent ebullition of the brine in the first pan results.
The same process takes place in the second pan, owing
to the calandria of the third pan acting as a condenser
of the vapour and producing a vacuum. The vapour
given off by the brine in the third pan is condensed by
means of a jet condenser. It will, therefore, be seen
that the highest vacuum and the lowest temperature
exist in the third pan, while the highest temperature
and lowest vacuum are found in the first pan. As the
salt is precipitated it falls to the bottom of the pans.
The bottom of each vacuum pan is connected with the
boot of a continuous bucket elevator, which is carried
in a cast-iron, water-tight casing to a level sufficiently
above that of the brine in the pans to ensure that they
shall be brine-sealed. The salt is delivered into waggons
and the brine drainage returns to the pans. The further
treatment of the salt crystals varies with the purpose
for which they are required. For table salt they are
subjected to grinding, but for export they are simply
allowed to drain.</p>

<p>The general aim of the Vacuum apparatus is to divide
the boiling process into two stages, in order to prepare
the brine beforehand by purification, and out of the
purified brine to produce the purest salt possible—chiefly
by boiling under atmospheric pressure—and to
acquire another liquor of the highest content in medium
salt. Balzberg, in his <cite xml:lang="de" lang="de">Die Erdesalz Erzeugung</cite>, has to
admit that the process results in the most complete
purification of the common salt, but in the conclusion
of his critical summary of the vacuum plant, he says:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>“At the same time it must be admitted that a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
complicated machine, which only gains, at a high cost,
advantages that can be achieved by more economical
and simpler means is of no use in practical business.
The question then arises as to whether it is necessary,
for the production of domestic or table salt, to have
pure chloride of sodium, and whether it pays to use
complicated machinery to attain this end.”</p>

  <div class="caption">THE HODGKINSON PATENT SALT-MAKING PLANT</div></div>

<p>While the largest size triple-effect vacuum plants are
capable of turning out 1,000 tons of salt per diem,
with brine at or near saturation, and produce about
6 tons of salt for the combustion of 1 ton of coal, it is
a very expensive process to operate as well as to install.
The cost of the plant ranges from £26,000 to £100,000,
and a large percentage of skilled labour is required in
its manipulation. But, despite the high initial cost,
and the fact that it only makes one grade of salt, it is
extremely complicated, and has to be stopped for
4 hours in each 24 for the purpose of boiling out and
cleaning up the pans, the vacuum plant is a highly
efficient piece of mechanism, and for a while it
remained the best and most economic system on the
market.</p>

<p>But the Vacuum process was not destined to remain
long without a rival. In point of fact, the merits of
the American invention had scarcely obtained recognition
when a new furnace was designed which, when
applied to the open-pan system and subjected to
practical tests, proved an entire success. The late
James Hodgkinson, the patentee, was not a salt-man,
but the head of a Manchester firm of engineers and
machinery manufacturers, and it was a professional
visit to a salt-works which revealed to him the crudity
of the brine-boiling operation and gave him the idea of
adapting to the salt furnaces a mechanical stoker of
his own invention, which was already being operated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
for other manufacturing purposes. In the development
of his idea, and with his mechanical stoker as its foundation,
he perfected the Hodgkinson Patent Salt-Making
Process, the advantages of which over all other processes
for the manufacture of salt from brine have been
summarized by Sir Thomas H. Holland, D.Sc., F.R.S.,
under the following six <span class="locked">heads—</span></p>

<p>1. Complete utilization of the heat derived from the
fuel employed.</p>

<p>2. The absolute maintenance uniformly of this heat.</p>

<p>3. The fact that finely-divided first-quality table salt
can be produced in the dry form fit for dispatch to the
market without grinding or other preparation.</p>

<p>4. The fact that coarsely crystallized salt can be
produced at the same time as the finest table salt.</p>

<p>5. That the proportion of the different grades of salt
can be varied at will, as well as maintained constantly,
to suit the varying requirements of the market.</p>

<p>6. The automatic and continuous removal of the salt
as fast as it is precipitated from the brine.</p>

<p>The essential features of the Hodgkinson plant consist
of (<i>a</i>) a mechanically-stoked furnace for the production
of heat; (<i>b</i>) a primary closed evaporating pan, 30 ft.
in diameter; (<i>c</i>) two secondary circular pans, 25 ft. in
diameter; (<i>d</i>) four open rectangular pans, 60 ft. by 25 ft.;
(<i>e</i>) a series of folded steam-jacketed pipes for heating
the inflowing brine by the waste steam; and (<i>f</i>) a
condensing arrangement to produce a partial vacuum
in the closed pans.</p>

<p>The Hodgkinson furnace is not placed under the
pan, as in the old system, but in front of the
plant, and the heated gases pass under the primary
pan, where the temperature ranges between 1,800 and
2,000°F. In this primary pan is made a finer and better
salt than can be manufactured by any other system<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
in the world. Moreover, by means of the mechanically-stoked
furnace, and the consequent uniform high
temperature, it is possible, for the first time, to control
the character of the salt produced. Where the temperature
varies, as in the open-pan system, crystals
of varying shapes and sizes are produced, and this
mixed salt must be ground to make it suitable for table
purposes. Where steam heat is employed, as in the
vacuum process, the temperature is not high enough
to make crystals of the smallest size. By the Hodgkinson
system the primary pan produces a precipitation
which requires no grinding, which flows in a cascade of
salt from the pan, and can be delivered to the consumer
without having come into contact with the hand of
man in the whole course of the operation.</p>

<p>The heated gases, having passed under the primary
pan, are then divided and sent under the two secondary
pans, and from thence they pass under the open rectangular
pans, the gases being distributed by the broken
columns of brickwork on which the pans stand. The
temperature of the gases passing under the open pans
commences at about 600° F., and gradually decreases to
about 200° F. under the farthest pans. By the automatic
regulation of the temperature, the waste gases
are utilized to produce salts of the various degrees of
coarseness required for the dairy, the stock-yard, and
fishery purposes. In the two secondary closed pans,
finely divided table salt is also produced, but it is
possible, by opening the manhole traps in the covers,
to increase the size of the crystal and make dairy salt
in these pans. The coarser crystals and flake salts are
made in the open pans in which the crystallization is at
the lowest rate. The grain of the salt can be altered at
will. In order to meet any change in the market
requirements, coarser salt can be produced at a moment’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
notice in the secondary pans. One very marked
superiority of the whole system over all other processes
is seen in the fact that a change in the type of salt
produced can be immediately effected, and a constant
and uniform output of any combination of products
can be absolutely guaranteed.</p>

<p>The improvements which the Hodgkinson plant has
effected in the open-pan system are: the increased
production of from 2 to 7 tons of salt from the combustion
of 1 ton of coal, the production of the finest table salt
without grinding, and of every grade of salt from the
flour-fine table to the coarsest fishery salt, in one and
the same operation, and the saving of time that is
required in all other processes for scraping and cleaning
the pans. Its superiority over the Vacuum system lies
in the facts that its initial cost is about £4,000, as against
anything from £26,000 to £100,000; that the majority
of the work being automatic, the expense of specially
trained, skilled labour is dispensed with; that it is
operated for 24 hours a day as against 20; requires no
grinding process in the manufacture of table salt; and
produces every grade of salt simultaneously. Sir
Thomas Holland, while studying the Hodgkinson
process in operation, is said to have exclaimed: “This
is not an improvement, it is a revolution”; and in his
subsequent report upon the process, he has declared
that it “has an enormous advantage over any known
process for the production of salt.”</p>

<span class="subhead">THE SALT MARKET</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Although</span> no purpose would be served by dealing in
detail with other of the many schemes that have been
elaborated in the past three hundred years for the
improvement of brine salt manufacture, the complete
list of patents that have been taken out for the purpose
constitutes a record of almost unrelieved failure which
would occupy many pages. It has always been obvious
to every intelligent investigator outside the little circle
of salt proprietors, that the open-pan process was a
survival of the dark ages, but the principle governing
the precipitation of salt from brine is so simple that the
equal difficulty presented itself to the practical salt-men,
of either effecting further simplification or of securing
further economies by the elaboration of the process.
Individuals in every generation recognized that the
methods of mediaevalism cried aloud for revision, but
the salt trade resolutely and consistently set their faces,
and their hands, against every suggested innovation.
The salt-men were the avowed enemies of Thomas
Lowndes, they drove Chrysel back to Saxony, they
loaded Furnival with misfortune and landed him in
gaol. In 1890, an official of the Salt Union reflected
with grim complaisance that, although no trade had
had more patents applied to it than the salt trade, no
trade could show so large a percentage of failures in
the matter of reformed methods, and since all the companies
that had brought forward new plants and processes
in competition with the Salt Union had come
short of success, he piously concluded that the system
which had survived the trial of generations must be
the fittest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span></p>

<p>The opposition of the salt trade to the introduction
of new methods of manufacture is explained by the
fact that the profits accruing from the old, clumsy,
crude, and wasteful process were so large that the
proprietors could see no possible reason for welcoming
innovations. Moreover, the manufacture under established
conditions was in the hands of a comparatively
small number of makers, who could not adopt new
measures without letting in more men, and the long
tenure of their monopoly made the salt-men intolerant
of a competitive system. Opposition was so abominable
to them that, while they would combine as one man to
keep out the daring intruder, or to crush such an one
if he succeeded in getting in, they were not at all averse
from employing similar tactics for the purpose of
exterminating one another. Although it had cost them
over a quarter of a million sterling to dispose of William
Furnival, the game of price-cutting was not discontinued
after 1833. In order to safeguard themselves against
the periodical falls in prices, which, if persisted in,
would mean wholesale ruin, all sorts of associations,
syndicates, trusts, committees, and pools were formed
for the regulation of stocks and prices, but each successive
combination was successively abandoned, and was
followed by another period of bitter jealousy and
trading loss. Between 1846 and 1880, the trade was
being continually reorganized for offensive and defensive
commercial purposes, but, in 1881, it was admitted that,
in spite of all attempts to encourage a better feeling
among the leading manufacturers, “the spirit of envy,
hate, malice, and all uncharitableness, which has so
long been the bane of the salt trade, has again become
rampant,” with the result that the price of common
salt—4s., less the brokers’ discount of 5 per cent.—was
the lowest that it had touched since the American<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
Civil War. Two years later it was declared that the
trade, instead of being ruled by common sense and
business experience, was being ruined by personal
animosities and trade jealousies.</p>

<p>The files of the <cite>Northwich Guardian</cite> at this period
chronicle the development of a state of affairs which
must be almost without parallel in any other trade.
During 1883 the violent competition continued, resulting
in heavy loss, the closing of many works, and a large
increase in bankruptcies. In 1884, the <cite>Guardian</cite>
declared that “the battle is fast becoming a war of
giants.... Capital is showing itself, almost everywhere,
a remorseless Juggernaut, crushing thousands of
victims beneath its ponderous wheels.” In that year
a proposal to form the trade into one huge company
was frustrated by the bitterness of internal jealousies.
Further attempts to bring all the salt proprietors into
a combination for mutual protection and profit were
made and abandoned from the same cause. “It is
easy to make laws and regulations and to carry them
out successfully when men are governed by the ordinary
laws of business and common sense,” commented the
<cite>Guardian</cite> in 1886, “but when sentiment or passion is
allowed to interfere, it is impossible either to make
sensible laws or carry them out successfully when made.”</p>

<p>In March, 1888, we read that “the great struggle for
mastery still goes on”; in April, “the process of exhaustion
is not yet complete,” and the deplorable state of
the salt trade was attributed to “a few men who seem to
have made more money than they know what to do
with, and are spending it in seeing what amount of
injury they can do to each other, and as a necessary
consequence to numbers of others who are innocent
of offence.” In May, a correspondent of the same
journal deplored the material damage the trade was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
suffering through the perversity and selfishness of the
salt proprietors, and he came to the conclusion that
their object was “not really to do business but to kill
one another out.” “Is there more morality,” he asked,
“in the man of means starving out the man without
means by selling, below cost of make, than there would
be in stopping him on the highway and picking his
pocket?... When the intention in the two cases is
the same—the plunder or ruin of the opponent—how
can the morality differ? It does seem a most grievous
thing that when the greater number in the trade are
anxious to do business at a profit to themselves ...
they should be prevented because a few—a very few—should
think only of themselves, and care nothing for
the sufferings of others, and carry on the fight to the
bitter end, causing enormous suffering and distress....”
“We can see very clearly,” he concluded, “that if something
is not done shortly to bring about a better state
of affairs, some defensive action must be taken by those
firms outside the present strife which will result in no
good to the parties now responsible for the mischief.”</p>

<p>The “defensive action” referred to was already being
formulated, and in October, 1888, was issued the
prospectus of the Salt Union Limited, which was formed
with a capital of £4,000,000 for the purpose of consolidating
the undertakings of the Salt Proprietors in
the United Kingdom, “with a view to ending reckless
competition which injuriously affects the salt industry
without conferring any adequate advantage on the
public.” By virtue of the sixty-four agreements,
covering the purchase of properties involving the
inclusive payment of £3,704,519, the Union became
the greatest salt proprietors in the world, and the
success of the flotation was described as “almost
unprecedented.” Apparently the only two newspapers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
that had the least dubiety concerning the success of the
venture were <cite>The Times</cite> and the <cite>Northwich Guardian</cite>.
<cite>The Times</cite>, while recognizing that the primary object
of the movement, viz., that of “curtailing supply and
creating an artificial scarcity”—would be gained if an
effective monopoly could be secured, pointed out that:
“The Syndicate has not acquired the control of all
the mines or works at which salt is produced, and unless
they do this they will not have an absolute monopoly.”
The <cite>Guardian</cite> admitted that with careful management
the company would prosper, but, speaking from its
intimate knowledge of the spirit which animated the
salt-trade, it cautiously predicted that the first few
months’ operations would show whether the enterprise
could go on successfully. “The scheme is a gigantic
one, and may prove either a great blessing or a great
curse, according to the principles on which it is conducted.
Let us hope that a spirit of justice and fairness
towards shareholders, servants, and the public at large
will make the scheme a blessing.”</p>

<p>The warning voiced by <cite>The Times</cite> with regard to
the Salt Union’s inefficient monopoly was justified
almost immediately by the issue of prospectuses of
rival salt schemes, and although opposition of this kind
was treated by the Union with affected contempt, and
the public was assured that the insignificant salt lands
secured by rash outsiders were “such as to break the
hearts of all investors who might visit them,” the fact
remained, as was noted in November, 1889, that “the
most remarkable thing in connection with salt has been
the continuous fall in the price of Salt Union shares.”
The principle on which the valuation of the Union’s
acquisitions was made did not transpire, but <cite>The Times</cite>
understood that “the selling price has been quite
satisfactory to the vendors,” and the Chairman of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
Union, in 1896, was feign to confess that “never were
covenants so ingeniously framed as to cause lawsuits.”
It is not overstating the case to say that the terms
upon which the Salt Union purchased their properties
provides one of the most amazing instances of reckless
optimism in the history of comparatively modern
finance, and the subsequent administration of the
Company’s affairs was as unfortunate as the preliminary
settlements had been disastrous. In one law case with
a vendor from whom they had purchased for £600,000
a property which their own representative valued at
£400,000, they had to pay a further £60,000, and they
settled another action by selling for £125,000 a tract of
land which they had originally acquired for £372,000.
In 1895, they increased their capital to £4,200,000 by
issue of further debentures to the amount of £200,000;
and, in 1901, the capitalization of the Union was reduced
to £2,600,000. Up to 1913, they had paid away £117,451
for directors’ fees, travelling expenses, etc., £99,236 for
preliminary and Parliamentary expenses, law charges,
etc., and £723,985 for administration charges, and from
1896 to 1914 they had only paid (in 1907) one dividend
of ½ per cent. on the ordinary shares.</p>

distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
